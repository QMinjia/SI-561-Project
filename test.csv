5,5,5,5,Favorite place in town! We love Juan!
5,5,5,5,"This is our favorite go Italian restaurant. It鈥檚 cozy inviting environment draws us back every time. The menu has many authentic Italian dishes that I鈥檝e only seen in Italy, that are very affordable and absolutely delicious!"
4,4,5,4,"Met with a number of friends at Riccardo's.  It is a small, neighborhood gem.  The food is good and the staff lovely.  We had a good time and it was well priced.  Recommend"
5,5,5,5,El mejor restaurante italiano de Chicago. As铆 de simple. Excelente comida y mejor atenci贸n.
5,5,5,5,The service was great and everyone in our group really enjoyed their meals. I look forward to dining there again!
5,5,5,5,Best veal parmigiana I鈥檝e had in years and husband had delicious veal saltimbocca.
5,5,5,5,Loved this place!
4,4,5,4,"Enjoyed that there was no pressure to order fast, service was the best part of the meal honestly!! Negroni was so so but wine list very good."
5,5,5,5,"We love this place - consistently great food and great service!  A well-priced and interesting wine list focused on wines from Italy that we enjoy exploring.  Whether it's just the two of us or a larger group, we always have a wonderful time at Riccardo Enoteca!"
5,5,5,5,The staff is always fantastic.  From the host to any server.  The staff turnover is minimal which helps with their customer service a lot.  Juan was a fantastic server on this recent visit but the entire staff always helps each other and greets all of the customers.
5,5,5,5,Juan was a fantastic server! He recommended a wonderful wine and was the precise amount of attentive. Love this place and will definitely be back soon!
5,5,5,5,As always a wonderful dinning experience. Had company from out of town and they were so impressed with the food and the service.
5,5,5,5,"The food was amazing as always!  Because it was our anniversary, our server was extremely attentive and gave us some extras on the house. It was a great date at an amazing restaurant!!"
5,5,5,5,Our server Juan was so great. Attentive but not overbearing and everything we ordered was delicious.
5,5,5,5,Amazing!! We loved everything. Great experience:)
5,5,5,5,"We had dinner before the Barbra Streisand Concert on 06 August. The waiter brought us complimentary bruschetta along with our wine, which was delicious....tomatoes ripe and sweet and bread not saturated with olive oil. We ordered prosciutto & melon for our appetizer. Proscuitto thinly sliced and melon ripe and sweet. For our entr茅e, Veal Limone with Capers, Roasted Potatoes and Sauteed Spinach with a hint of garlic. The veal was lightly egg washed, served with a hint of lemon and the capers adding just  enough salt. Outstanding!!!! Only wish we had more time to savor another glass of wine and some of your delicious sounding desserts. We will be back."
5,5,5,5,"Ricardo Enoteca is a wonderful neighborhood gem with delightful food and outstanding service. I love seafood, and  recently enjoyed both grilled calamari and octopus there.I look forward to returning soon!"
5,5,5,5,"I love this place, so much. We came early on Saturday and were able to nab patio table which meant my mom's dog could be there, yay dog friendly restaurants! My dad will drive from Michigan just for the grilled calamari appetizer. Everything is always delicious, fetuccini Bolognese is a go to when I'm feeling indecisive, but they also always have great specials."
5,5,5,5,"We always have the best experience! The food is always superb and the service is so friendly. The staff always makes the extra effort to ensure you have a wonderful dining experience. Our server, Jos茅, was simply the best! I don鈥檛 think I鈥檝e ever had a bad meal here. Outstanding."
5,5,5,5,Always a favorite.  The perfect neighborhood spot.
5,5,5,5,I love this place! Riccardo Trattoria is family fave since it has opened and Enoteca as well.
5,5,5,4,Gave us free bruschetta which was nice. Place was weirdly quiet post work on a Friday. Good attention from the servers thouvh
5,5,5,5,"Party of six celebrating a reunion and eating al fresco. Excellent food, service and surroundings. Small and intimate with good food!"
5,5,5,5,"Love this place, one of our favorites!  Truly great Italian food, you won鈥檛 be disappointed!"
5,5,5,4,The food was excellent and the service was even better!
5,5,5,3,"Inside restaurant wasn't great for family (kids / noise level) as was quiet and intimate. But once we moved outside, the food and service was fantastic, and had great meal."

2,3,1,2,Waitress who had a bad attitude from inception It made the dining experience very uncomfortable
5,0,0,0,This place is phenomenal. My only complaint is that maybe the seating could be a little more comfortable but the food and wine pairings are so good that it doesn't really matter.
4,4,5,4,"The food was very good, the service was outstanding and he atmosphere rustic and enjoyable.  I will return."
4,4,5,4,Glad we went! The Staff was very friendly and energetic and always helpful. Rich Table is a "must try".
5,5,5,4,Husband 40 birthday
5,5,5,4,"Our server, Dana, was fantastic! When I told her that I brought a 鈥渂ig wine 鈥 to share with our friends, she immediately offered to decant the bottle. We had a symphony performance after dinner, and she made sure that we were able to leave the restaurant in time to make our curtain. Dana was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable regarding the menu.  She made our evening more enjoyable. The food was top rate. We shared appetizers and each had an entree. We especially liked the porcini donuts, rock cod, and rib eye steak covered with onion rings. Looking forward to returning in the future."
5,5,5,4,We鈥檝e come here for Anniversary a few times now. We always have a good meal. Excellent food. Always tasty. One of our favorites in SF.
5,5,5,5,"Very Imaginative cooking, served very ""warmly"" professionally, totally non-pretentious totality. Quite enjoyable and special."
5,5,5,5,"Excelllent food and a highly trained staff who know the menu and knows even better how to make you feel at ease.  A fantastic experience from start to finish. We will be back - if we can get a reservation, that is!"
5,5,5,5,"Bday, great atmosphere and vibe"
5,5,5,5,"Yes, this is a great restaurant. We had the tasting menu with the pairings. There were three of us and we basically got the entire menu and each dish was fantastic. The pairings suited every dish and the best part was each of us had a different dish with a different pairing and it was a true in depth and varied tour of mostly local wines and beers and ciders. A very fun evening. Hope to return!"
5,5,5,5,"Loved it! Delicious food, attentive staff, what more does one ask for."
5,0,0,0,"Great night and food at Rich table. Per ballet meal. All dishes were exceptionally good from the signature donuts, to the soft shell crab and the various pastas. The lasagna was unusual and good, the bucatini with peas and mint a nice blend with cheese topping."
5,5,4,5,"My wife and I were passing by San Francisco, heard great review about this place. The food were amazing, we will definitely come again."
5,5,5,5,"Great night and food at Rich table. Per ballet meal.  All dishes were exceptionally good from the signature donuts, to the soft shell crab and the various pastas.  The lasagna was unusual and good, the bucatini with peas and mint a nice blend with cheese topping."
5,5,5,5,"First time to RT 鈥 we were not disappointed! The buccatini was our favorite pasta dish. Highly recommend. We ordered the hush puppies and perrogies as well, both of which were excellent. Most people around us got the porcini doughnuts though, probably should鈥檝e had those as they seemed popular. 10/10!"
4,4,4,5,"Great food, but overpriced, and wine list is crazy. Starts at $60, and wine wasn't even that nice. Also charged for bread and butter, which is always annoying. Great menu, but you really need a large group to do it justice by sharing. There are too many courses for two to enjoy."
5,5,5,5,"This was one of the best experiences I have ever had.  There are a lot of wonderful, unique restaurants in San Francisco.....but this one is particularly special.  I recommend doing the chef's tasting menu.  Also, the Rich Table cookbook is a lot of fun."
5,5,5,5,"Our dinner and dessert with Tiffany and her associates was phenomenal - can鈥檛 wait to go back!  Thanks so much, everyone."
4,4,5,5,a little bit salty. The ingredients are all fresh and special.
5,5,5,5,Food and drinks were amazing and service was wonderful.
5,5,5,5,You guys are the best!!! Keep doing it!!!! Thanks!
5,5,5,5,"Amazing funky food. 鈥淔it for foodies鈥滻f you鈥檙e from out of town, don鈥檛 miss this spot"
5,5,5,5,The food was delicious and the service warm and helpful. The server鈥檚 suggestions were perfect in terms of portions and dishes.
5,5,5,4,Anniversary
5,5,5,5,"Great dinner for my fianc茅e鈥檚 birthday! Amazing service, thank you Dana."
4,4,4,5,"Stunning food. Super fresh and tasty. Combinations might be a bit odd sometimes and flavours do not always blend well together, though being super tasty on itself. Price quality is very good. Would recommend!"
5,5,5,5,Terrific experience. . A wonderful array of flavors and textures
5,5,5,5,Outstanding service and menu! Price point was also fantastic value
5,5,5,5,"It was a perfect decision to end the night at Rich Table.  Everything was fire.  Especially, the doughnuts, steaks, and the chicken liver mouses.  Delicious.  Defiantly worth going back and the wait!"
5,5,5,5,The food and service was amazing. Me and my partner ordered the Ribeye and the burger. It was absolutely delicious.
5,5,5,5,"Our service by Aracely & David was welcoming, and our dinner simply delicious..  We were not rushed, given space to enjoy our cocktails before diving into our appetizer ...a must have Avocado & Crab salad...light, flavorful & not too filling with generous firm bites of crab.  The special was a nice preparation of Crispy Skin on Red Snapper, which my husband raved about...for me I can't pass up Dover Sole, and it did not disappoint.  The new PB Mousse with Banana Ice Cream was a pleasant finish to a wonderful dining experience."
5,5,5,5,"While we sat at a terribly hectic table in the middle of the room and subjected to jostling waiters and tray traffic, the service, the food and the supper club spirit of RL saved the  evening and the experience.  The food is expertly prepared for its genre and our waiter was a master of his universe!  As one does at the end of any runway show, all I can say is BRAVO!  I will definitely go back but ask for a very specific table away froM the center fray."
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding  food, service and ambiance!"
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and atmosphere. They brought out a bday dessert and I didn鈥檛 even have to tell them after I put it into Open Table. So classy
2,1,2,3,Dessert menus placed on the table in the middle of several people eating their main dishes.   And less than one hour after being seated?That鈥檚 a first!(Way to undermine the experience).
5,5,5,5,"We celebrated 2 birthdays and got unbelievable service from the staff. I think our server was Lucas and he was amazing. The food was phenomenal (mini lobster rolls, soups, Dover Sole) and he brought birthday dessert plates without missing a beat. Loved it"
5,5,5,5,Excellent service. Food was great. Inviting atmosphere
5,5,5,5,I am a regular. Love it!
5,5,5,5,Favorite restaurant to never ever miss while being in Chicago.  Never disappoints!
2,5,1,4,Waiter was rude and they were anxious to rush us out.
5,5,5,5,Always a great time. Food is outstanding.
5,5,5,5,"The food, service and ambiance were excellent."
5,5,5,5,Love RL! It鈥檚 my go to place for business or social occasions.   It鈥檚 always consistently perfect.
5,5,5,5,Best Lake Perch in Chicago
5,5,5,5,Always amazing and perfect
5,5,5,5,"If you want the TOTAL RL experience, request Joseph as your waiter!!! Your every need will be fulfilled. We always have an enjoyable experience. He ensures that everything you want and need is provided. Besides being the best waiter in town. his pleasantpersonality makes it a fun time. Flavia, the manager is like a symphony maestro. She walks to each client to welcome them and ensure all is perfect. We love the place."
5,5,3,5,"Great place, I just did not like rushed by the server to order, eat, and finish. It was near closing time but I still did not like that. Everything else was awesome."
5,5,5,5,Excellent food!! Love the oysters and the crab cake !!! Drinks are the best !!
5,5,5,5,A must stop for us when in Chicago!  Never a disappointment.
5,5,5,5,Outstanding food and service
5,5,5,5,"RL Chicago was an amazing experience.  We had been at your location in Paris, France and knew we wanted to experience this location.    We will be back on our next trip to Chicago.  Thank you for making our time phenomenal."
5,5,5,5,It was great
5,5,5,5,"Delicious food, incredible ambiance, very attentive wait staff. Can鈥檛 wait to go back. The Beaujolais and Dover sole was amazing."
5,5,5,5,Best service ever! Always love my time at RL
5,5,5,5,Always a favorite in Chicago!  Diner with friends from Boston who were in town! Great service and food! Thank you!
5,5,5,5,Had the hamburger with French fries came out perfectly Awesome spot now one of my go to spots in Chicago Just go!
4,4,5,3,"Great Food Service and a quaint atmosphere ..,great location"
5,5,5,5,"Went for business lunch and the food and service was on point. We all got burgers cooked exactly to our likely and the lobster bisque, which was perfectly rich and flavorful. I plan to go back to sample the liver and the more adventurous french fare when I'm on my own or with more familiar company. 10/10!"
5,4,5,5,Tom is an amazing waiter!
4,5,4,4,The food was outstanding! And the old school ambiance was nice too.
2,5,1,4,"Our server, Jeffrey, was incredibly inattentive, and, when he actually took the time to wait on our table, he was abrupt, inappropriately familiar, patronizing and made promises upon which he didn鈥檛 deliver with regard to satisfying basic requests for another round, refreshed bread service, coming back to the table shortly, etc . I regularly dine at RL, and will make sure to specify that I鈥檇 like to be as far away from Jeffrey as possible on future visits. It was *incredibly* disappointing experience. Almost a joke, really."
5,5,5,5,He鈥檚 Back!!!! Thank God!!!  Seeing Joseph serving people ensured we were going to be treated to the best dining experience in Chicago. The other waiters valiantly held the fort while Josephwas out with sciatica. But there is NO replacing Joseph. the best waiter in Chicago
5,5,5,5,We enjoyed a comfortable brunch. Food was good and service was excellent. We look forward to returning again soon.
5,5,5,5,"What a beautiful spot to take time out of the hustle and bustle of Chicago. You are transported to a lovely library with leather seats, linen on the tables, perfect flatware, and brilliant service. It鈥檚 a must every time I visit Chicago. Don鈥檛 miss this!"
5,5,5,5,Every time I come to Chicago I always visit RL for lunch.  Took my entire family this weekend and they fell in love with RL.  Husband said best lunch he has ever had!
5,5,5,5,"Always excellent. Delicious food, cozy atmosphere and our water Jose is fabulous.  Love everything about this place!"
5,5,5,5,Excellent as always
5,5,5,5,Never a disappointment!  Wonderful food and service!
5,5,4,5,"It鈥檚 the coziest and slightly most uncomfortable room in the city. Haha. Close tables but you forget it all as you鈥檙e well tended to enjoying outstanding food in a very lavish setting. Never had a bad meal here. The Wagyu beef in blankets and the shrimp cocktail are mainstays. Veal Milanese perch, and the burger are awesome. The dessert menu has something for everyone!"
5,5,5,5,Getting married
4,4,4,5,It was a nice restaurant with good food.
5,5,5,5,Our waiter Andre was excellent-every food item and beverage were great- love the decor-very clean- all staff friendly and attentive
5,5,5,5,First time there. Will for sure return. Really enjoyed it. Fantastic service  too
5,5,5,5,A must every time I鈥檝e been there the food is delicious!!
3,3,2,3,This place is PACKED! We had a 930pm reservation and didn鈥檛 get seated until almost 10pm! Service was so-so and food was okay....NOTHING worth sitting in the NOISY open floor plan. Rices weren鈥檛 bad -pasta dishes were $14-18 but SUPER SMALL portions.....on par with appetizers.
5,5,5,5,Very classy. Jessica was a great server. Everything was delicious and came out perfectly.
2,3,2,3,"They made us wait for over 30 mins and were unapologetic about it. Wait staff was nice, but not as professional as you would expect given prices. The restaurant was also so hot that it was difficult to even stand patiently in the entranceway, even without coats on. There were times during the wait that we had to step outside into the cold.  We probably won鈥檛 go back. So many good restaurants in Chicago and this isn鈥檛 one to stand in line to wait for."
5,5,5,5,"Great servers, gave great recommendations! Made the night very special! Favorite spot to come to in Chicago."
5,4,4,4,"The waitresses was great ! Loved the birthday meal, just wasn鈥檛 a huge fan of the seats. Other than that, it was great"
5,5,5,5,Amazing dinner! Leye never disappoints. Our waiter Dre was fantastic.
5,5,5,5,Been going to RPM since they opened and the quality and service have been consistently outstanding!
2,5,1,5,Second time we鈥檝e been there first time great food great service second time great food bad waitress. Made us feel like we didn鈥檛 belong asked her to take a picture of our table because it was my wife and daughter鈥檚 birthday she said she had to think about it ended up asking one of the ma卯tre d鈥欌檚 he took it right away. She started to explain the menu but we stopped her and asked about a drink at another table her answer was can I finish with the menu items first. We weren鈥檛 concerned about ordering right away we wanted to get a few drinks to celebrate the birthday very rarely came back to the table to ask us about things
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely fantastic service from the moment we arrived.   We were early for our reservation, so we sat in the bar.  That staff was so accommodating when we went to our table and so was the main room staff!   Delicious prosciutto pairing and the special risotto with truffle.   Will be back anytime I come to Chicago!"
5,5,5,5,"We are from out of town. When we fly into Chicago this is always one of our go to restaurant stops. It is up beat but also romantic. Has great lighting. We have over a number of visits, ordered many different entrees and have not had one ever disappoint.  Great bar area to sit if there is a wait. We really enjoy this restaurant and highly recommend it!"
5,4,5,5,Great food and service! The steak was overcooked though.
3,5,2,4,I waited 40 minutes for a table when I already had a reservation. Very disappointed in how the hostess treated me when asking if our table would be ready.
5,5,5,5,Excellent!
3,3,1,2,"Seated nearly an hour after our reservation time...service was slow and inattentive, dirty plates piled up on our table through each course.  Pastas were presented nicely, and complimented well, but most were too al dente."
5,5,5,5,"Can't wait to go back! great wine and ambiance, even on a Sunday. Loved the waiter and he did a great job.  food was incredible"
5,5,5,5,From the moment we walked in everything was exceptional.  The ambiance is amazing. The staff couldn鈥檛 have been more attentive.  The menu was explained to us regarding portion size.  The food was amazing. Our waitress was so friendly and professional.  We didn鈥檛 need to ask for anything.  She anticipated what we needed. We were celebrating my birthday and they acknowled that from the moment we sat down.  They also gave me a little birthday treat.  Would definitely return next time we visit Chicago.
5,5,5,5,Our service Jackie was amazing
5,5,5,5,"One of my favorite spots to come to. Consistently amazing...from the food, to the service, to the ambiance. Been here several times and will always come back!"
2,2,1,2,"I will not be going back, nor will I recommend this place again.  They are over rated and used to treat their clientele so much better!   We arrived 30 minutes early for our 9:45 reservation.  And we weren't seated until 10:15pm!  They seated us in a booth right outside the kitchen, and the vent above the table must have been connected to the grill, because it smelled like it.  After asking to move tables, they just moved us back to the bar to a comunity high top.  NOT exactly what I was looking for in a nice dinner!  If I wanted to sit in the bar to eat, I know I could have been seated much earlier.  I waited for a nice table for a relaxing meal, and ended up back in the bar 45 minutes later at 11pm!! I was taking out of town friends around town and thought this would be a nice place.  Evening went to hell here and I left before having dinner."
5,5,5,5,"My fianc茅 and I had a delicious meal. It consisted of the ricotta spread over ciabatta toast, shared meatballs which were delicious, truffles nudi鈥檚, and a bone-in veal chop. We made sure to enjoy a bottle of Kith and Kin Cabernet Sauvignon. The appetizer and main courses were exceptional. For dessert we enjoyed an order of 4 mini cannolis and 3 small scoops of gelato. The price of our meal was way below expectations. This place is a great take on traditional but still indulgent Italian food. Great ambiance. Cannot recommend enough."
4,4,3,5,We鈥檝e eaten here many time and sadly this round was my least favorite.  Our server wasn鈥檛 fun/nice ... super serious.  And the Brussels sprout salad and gnocchi were very bland/no flavor.  A friend had the risotto and it was off the charts delicious!
5,5,5,5,Excellent restaurant in all aspects. We鈥檒l go back.
5,5,5,5,Food and service were outstanding!
5,5,5,5,LOVE this restaurant!!!!   One reminder (and this is probably common sense to most people) is that reservations don't mean your table is going to be ready exactly on time.  If you have a show or something that you need to be at following dinner I'd highly suggest you arrive 20 minutes prior to your reservation if you hope to be seated on time.
4,5,5,5,"Seriously one of the best meals I've ever had! From the pizzette with pepperoni to the bucatini with pomodoro, ribeye filet, sea scallops, whipped potatoes, almafi lemon cake and a peach bellini to top it off, I have to say it was the best way to celebrate my birthday!"
3,3,5,4,"Small portions. Heavy on the oregano across a number of dishes. Ordered several apps and 4 different pasta dishes based on the server's recommendations.  The service was excellent but the food lackluster. My drink was also watery with more ice cubes than drink. Despite a reservation they sat us at the first table in the restaurant.  This spot would have us constantly bumped by patrons walking in and it would be cold due to being in front of the doors. I asked for another spot and they sat us at the 2nd worst spot, right in front of the kitchen entry. Better than being cold I guess.  Too many other good Italian restos to come back here."
5,4,5,5,I came here for a birthday dinner and was not disappointed. The prices are pretty high for the amount of food that you get so I would recommend saving this for a special occasion. Everything we ate and drank was delicious and the service was incredible. I'll definitely be back!
5,5,5,5,This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The food and drink has always been fantastic and the service is wonderful. Very upscale decor and quiet but prices are very reasonable.
5,5,5,5,"PRM Italian is a place I go to every time in Chicago - the food, service, and atmosphere are top-notch."
5,5,5,5,"Our party of three ordered three different appetizers, pasta dishes and desserts along with the Red Snapper. I had the opportunity to try it all and it was delicious. The staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I have a friend going to Chicago tomorrow with her husband and I recommend RPM Italian to them."
5,5,5,5,"Our server Noel was very good, and so was the overall meal"
5,5,5,4,"From out of town, would certainly go back. The food was excellent, especially the artichokes! The service was good and personable. Highly recommend."
4,4,4,5,We felt a little rushed to order and food came out way too fast.   Before wine was served.  Other than that everything was good.
4,4,4,4,Everything was delicious service was great.
5,5,5,5,"First time here and the ambiance, food and service was outstanding.  The steak was seasoned perfectly. The pasta was  fabulous . Our server Nina G was also outstanding. She had a great personality. Would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,5,5,5,We were out on a special date after our engagement photos. The service and food was outstanding. We will definitely be back.
4,5,4,4,The food was great and the service was excellent except for forgetting to bring my wife鈥檚 glass of wine with the meal.
5,5,5,5,Husbands birthday... service extraordaire !!! Food was excellent
5,5,5,5,Everything was perfect. Great lunch
5,5,5,5,"Amazing restaurant...service was 1st class, crab bisque was best we ever had (although pricey), dinner meals was very good.  Would highly recommend!"
5,5,5,5,4 different entrees. All excellent.   Always get a little pasta on the side!
5,5,5,5,Delivery food & great service. Never disappointed.
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful food, great ambience, attentive server, and a great visit from Paco."
5,5,5,5,Always the best food and service.
5,5,5,5,Always great!
5,5,5,5,One of my favorite restaurants. Great service. Paco is always there to greet you!
5,5,5,5,"We were visiting Galveston and made reservations after looking at the menu. The service and food were unbelievable . It was one of the best  experiences we have ever had . Our waiter Johnson, was just awesome . Then right when you think it can鈥檛 get better the owner Paco, talked it up with us as we were leaving ! What a great place ! Don鈥檛 miss the opportunity to dine there !"
5,5,5,5,"Nice friendly atmosphere, they make you feel like a local, good menu selections"
5,5,5,5,"We brought friends from KY for a special evening. As always, we were not disappointed. The food & service were excellent."
5,5,5,5,Great place!!!!
5,5,5,5,"The EXPERIENCE is a rare treat. The way the excellent food is presented is a memory maker. This restaurant is casual elegance with southern charm.  Rely on your waiter to guide you through the selections, according to your tastes.   Plan on approx 100.00USD  per person and enjoy a wonderful evening meal. We would definitely recommend to anyone that is not budget constrained. Valet parking did not appear to be available, so check this out and not let it spoil your evening."
5,5,5,5,We had a wonderful family meal with our adult daughter after a long day of work for all. The food and ambience were great the the service outstanding. I look forward to dining here again and again.
5,5,5,4,"Fabulous for service, our waitress Valerina was excellent, could not fault her. The food was fantastic, we chose a special of surf n turf which we shared. Tad on the pricey side, but with sharing it was OK. In fact we shared the starter as well. We did not have dessert as the portions were V large.Paco appeared towards the end of the meal and enquired whether we had enjoyed the experience- we certainly had!!"
5,5,5,5,Love having a great place to bring friends visiting from out of town. Consistently exceptional and everyone leaves happy and satisfied.
5,5,5,5,Always a pleasure!
5,5,5,5,"We only get to Galveston once or twice a year, but we make sure to dine at Rudy and Paco's. Rudy's attention to detail and dedication make this a five-star experience every time. Everything I have tried here is excellent and the service is unmatched."
5,5,5,5,Service was impressive. Food was delicious.  Nice atmosphere. Highly recommend
5,5,5,5,"I would;d definitely go back service was great , my wife and I had a great time for her bday"
5,5,5,5,This is the third time we have been on vacation on our anniversary and each time we celebrate at Rudy and Paco鈥檚.   Food was amazing as always and it鈥檚 always a pleasure to interact with Paco and he 鈥渉osts鈥 his customers.  We will be back every chance we get
4,4,5,4,We had a good time. Great service. Little close to neighbors.
5,5,4,5,"Always a favorite!!  One of the few places where dining matches price. I go at lunch as I like smaller plates; however, always plenty of food"
5,5,5,5,Awesome food and service
5,5,5,5,"this is our ""go-to"" place because of the atmosphere, food, presentation, elegance and maybe most of all... Paco himself.  Always love the tomahawk steak which is personally carved & seasoned tableside by Paco.  One of the best steaks around and always cooked to perfection!"
5,5,5,5,It was fantastic!It was Mikes birthday and the food and service were excellent
5,5,5,5,"Rudy & Paco鈥檚 is one of my all time favorite restaurants. Everything from the first bite of the appetizer to the last bite of dessert is absolutely amazing. The service is the best I have ever experienced. Paco, the owner, is a true jewel of Galveston. I can not say enough good things about this place!"
5,5,5,4,This is the place I have my biz lunch every time I鈥檓 in Galveston. Exceptional food with exceptional service.
4,4,5,5,Great restaurant to take someone you want to impress. The service is impeccable.
5,5,5,5,"Needless to say, we're stuffed! As always, the meal was prepared to perfection and the flavor was sinful. R&P never disappoints. The entire waitstaff is so attentive. I always tell people it's not just the food that's unbelievable, but rather it's the experience of the evening that satisfies. We totally enjoyed our ""experience "" at R&P tonight. We will return!!! Thanks Paco!!"
5,5,5,5,the best restaurant in Galveston. the Grooper was outstanding.
5,5,5,5,"The food and service is never anything but top-notch.  Paco has always greeted us at the door and makes us feel like old friends.  If this place was in Houston, you'd have to reserve a table months in advance to get seated.  It's that good."
5,5,5,5,"This is a no nonsense ""old school"" restaurant, has a dress code and enforces it.  And, I for one am glad they do.  Excellent food, great service and Paco Vargas is the best!"
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding food, service, & ambiance... as always!"
5,5,5,5,Paco is always lovely and greeted our table as usual.  The fish was amazing and incredibly fresh.  Perfect tablecloth service.  Love this place so much.
5,5,5,5,Always the best meal and service of any restaurant in Texas.  Our absolute favorite place for any occasion and we drive two hours just to dine here.  Paco always visits every table to thank and ask about your experience.  Wonderful all around!
5,5,5,5,Wonderful!!
5,5,5,5,The food & service were perfect!
5,5,5,5,VG. Very good as usual
5,5,5,5,"We took a young couple with us to Ruth's Chris that had never been. They were completely blown away by the experience. As usual, the steaks were perfectly prepared and all the appetizers and sides were delicious. Our waiter Grant took care of our every need and we could not have had a better time. The General Manager Chris Bachman has made the Baton Rouge location the best RC's there is by a long shot!!!"
5,4,5,5,The wine prices are reasonable and the corkage is free.  There are not many high end steakhouses that will compete with that!
5,5,5,5,My aunt and uncle took me to Ruth鈥檚 for my birthday. We always have a great time there and this time was no different. The food and service are always impeccable.
5,5,5,5,Great service and food!
5,5,5,5,Awesome!   Amazing food and service.
5,5,5,5,My husband and I decided to try this restaurant out and we were not disappointed!  The food and service were top notch and by far some of the best we have ever had.  It is definitely a place worthy of a visit on a special occasion.
5,5,5,5,Always consistently amazing!
5,5,5,4,Alan- he made the meal.
5,5,5,5,This was the best place I have ever been & im quite picky. Our waiter Evan was so helpful & showed me new things! We will be back!
5,5,5,5,Ruth鈥檚 Chris has the best steaks anywhere! The atmosphere is wonderful and the service was excellent as always.
5,5,5,4,Great service!
5,5,5,4,Great service.  Excellent steaks cooked to perfection.  Veggies wonderful as always.  Desserts are incredible.  Best place to come and wrap up a great day after a Tigers home game!
5,5,5,5,An outstanding experience at Ruth Chris!!!It is a treat to go there..... the service & food was outstanding!!Thank you!!!
5,5,5,4,Great steak and wine with great friends!
5,5,5,5,Food was excellent!  Great staff!
5,5,5,5,Always fantastic!
5,5,5,5,"PEREFECT!! As, always...Still, the hand's down BEST in BATON ROUGE."
5,5,5,5,"As always, our evening went well. The food was excellent and our usual server Jared was on point. The harvest salad is great as well as the crab cakes. I also recommend the wedge salad, the filet, and the potatoes au gratin."
5,5,5,5,"The cowboy rib-eye is the best steak offered. Bone gives it a flavor that can鈥檛 be beat. Fork tender. Sides phenomenal, service impeccable.  Only place in town for a steak."
5,5,5,5,Excellent as always
5,5,5,5,Wonderful evening and great service.
5,5,5,5,This is our Special occasion restaurant! The service is impeccable and the food "is to die for" !! We have been coming to Ruth's Chris for the last 5 years and have never been disappointed! Our favorite is the Porterhouse for 2 with Lobster Mac and cheese and Sweet Potato Casserole!
2,2,4,3,Food wasn鈥檛 up to par
4,4,5,3,"Meeting granddaughter from LSU.Great way to visit.Jared, our waiter, was most informative and delightful.Wonderful evening"
5,5,5,4,Excellent!!
5,5,5,5,Absolutely Fabulous!  Cannot wait to go back to this Ruth Chris location.
5,5,5,5,Great food. Very pricey
5,5,5,5,"Everything was great from start to finish.  Cucumber basil gimlet was refreshing.  The stuffed mushrooms were delicious.  We had the filet, garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach for our meal.  For dessert our server, Francesca, brought out a blueberry cheesecake with a birthday message.  The Ruth鈥檚 coffee was a great way to wrap up the meal.  Incredible dining experience!"
5,5,5,5,Dana was awesome and will request her when we come back. Food was fabulous as usual !!!! Thank you and see you all soon !!!!
5,5,5,5,"This Ruth Chris Steak House is the best!  We love Ruth Chris and have been to many Ruth Chris locations and this location is the BEST of all.  The drinks, food and service are excellent!"
5,5,5,5,Made my wife鈥檚 birthday a very pleasant experience.
5,5,5,5,"We had a great birthday dinner! Food, drinks, and dessert were all so delicious! Would highly recommend!"
5,5,5,5,Wonderful as always!
5,5,5,4,"Not a fan of chain restaurants but since it was founded in New Orleans and this is the second oldest Ruth鈥檚 Chris after the original one, I consider it more of a NOLA outpost than a chain. Nevertheless, the place is just so consistent with food and service that I can鈥檛 help but rate it highly鈥 absolutely one of the best restaurants in Baton Rouge. Yes this place is for business people and also for those who are unaccustomed to eating a high end meal but looking to celebrate, but still, the food is always interesting and good and there鈥檚 just something about their steak that makes it addictive. I鈥檝e never had anything that wasn鈥檛 seasoned or cooked properly. The service is sometimes over the top but I鈥檇 rather have that than inattentiveness or nonchalance. My only complaint is that the physical restaurant space needs a renovation. It鈥檚 almost comical how 1980s it feels in there鈥 look a dining room at mid-level country club. The ceiling tiles are particularly awful. In some weird way it gives the place a retro vibe, but we all know that鈥檚 NOT what they are going for. Overall, my highest recommendation for dining in Baton Rouge."
4,5,4,4,Parents Anniversary
5,5,5,5,Food and atmosphere was golden. Vincent our waiter was great.
5,5,5,5,Great steak!
5,5,5,5,Wonderful nite attentive waiter and the main event the steaks perfectly cooked in 鈥渟izzling butter鈥 as good or better than any Ruth Chris in the country and we we have been to at least 10 different cities
5,5,5,5,Excellent food. Creative flavors. Professional and courteous service.
5,5,5,4,Food and service wonderful as usual
5,5,5,5,Love this place! Never a bad meal or experience! Staff is excellent!
5,5,5,5,What a gem that we found. We loved it and will definitely be back. Great food and service. All around win!
5,5,5,5,Our dinner was quite possibly the best meal I have ever had in my life.  Will without a doubt return for another special night out.
5,5,5,5,Anniversary
5,5,5,5,The food and the staff were wonderful! They made our anniversary very special. Would highly recommend and will definitely be coming back!
5,5,5,4,"Outstanding, food, service and menu make this a gem!   Don't forget your wallet because quality isn't cheap.    Bring your own wine and know that this too will be expertly decanted by the staff.   Despite the fine dining-  the staff isn't rude, pretentious nor is it stuffy- they aim to please and are happy to accommodate all."
5,5,5,5,My wife and I love coming to the Saddle River Inn. The food and service is always exceptional!
5,5,5,5,Great restaurant.  Consistently great food and service.
5,5,5,5,We had a fabulous dinner toCelebrate my wife鈥檚 birthday
5,5,5,5,Exceptional experience across the board. 5 star restaurant
5,5,5,5,Exceptional service. Exceptional food. Absolutely delicious!
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I have been to the SRI many many times over the years . Our experience Tuesday night was exceptional. From start to finish food, service was what we come to expect. We were not disappointed.Can鈥檛 wait to return!"
5,5,5,5,Perfect spot for a special occasion
5,5,5,3,"Well I was impressed with the menu that chef Jamie Knott.  We had the lobster toast followed by a tasting of carrot and ginger soup topped with fennel oil.  Pompano and crack cakes were the main entrees and the crispy Brussels sprouts finished with apple cider were incredible. The desserts were out of this world. I have to give my thanks to pastry chef Leticia Menesis for her creative and thoughtful choices to end our fabulous dinner. The pana cotta was the best I have ever tasted!  The cheese cake was also delicious and portioned correctly for our meal! Lastly, I would like to single out our head waiter Nick who was on point throughout our experience. He was ably assisted by John. My only regret of the evening was failing to request a better table in the main dinning area on the first floor. Our host stuck us against the wall upstairs where everyone had to pass by all night."
5,5,5,5,Superb dinner with a wonderful quiet atmosphere. Staff was amazing.
3,3,1,3,The server was a little impatient  I guess hi wanted to go home early he rushed to take the order and at desert time we wanted to order coffee and he just walked away without us concluding the order.
5,5,5,4,Excellent meal as always
5,5,5,5,It鈥檚 a great date night place.  It鈥檚 fancy but very comfortable. Not stuffy. The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable and puts you at ease. The food is great.  Perfectly prepared and delicious.
5,5,5,5,Very Food service and food A little pricey but good for a special occasion dinner Just hard to get a reservation
5,5,5,5,Superb as always! Have been going there for years and will continue to do so! Never disappoints!
5,5,5,5,My friend and I had a wonderful evening celebrating a birthday at the Saddle River Inn.  The restaurant is warm and the staff very welcoming.  The menu and specials are creative and all the dishes are outstanding.  I had the tuna carpaccio and the branzino鈥攂oth fabulous.  Highly recommend this restaurant for any special occasion or just for an enjoyable evening out.
5,5,5,5,"Everything about the SRI is exceptional - the Host, the wait staff and, of course, the food."
5,5,5,4,"The restaurant is always on the mark with a combination of great food, service and ambience."
5,5,5,5,"Everything about our dining experience was excellent.  The food was outstanding and the portions were very generous.  The staff were attentive, timely and professional.  Simply the best in Bergen County."
5,5,5,5,Anniversary
5,5,5,5,Excellent expo!!
4,3,4,5,"Overrated, Entr茅es are just fair"
5,5,5,5,"We thought the meal was excellent, but the portions should be bigger. The appetizers especially were very small!!! The atmosphere was really nice and the service as well. The Duck was the best we ever had!!!"
5,5,3,5,Not the best service on this visit. Received the check when we had 1/4 bottle of wine left which we had to ask that he refill our glasses.
5,5,5,5,The best  I鈥檝e visited this place for 13 years
5,5,5,5,"Had not been there for a while, still great food and service.  Plan to go back again soon."
5,5,5,5,"How rare it is when everything is perfect.  The truffle fries are sooooo freaking good you don't need any ketchup or anything else. The filet is superb.  Oh, and the Sichuan spicy noodles are to die for. In fact, I wouldn't mind having that as a main course!I'm surprised this isnt a Mich starred restaurant, although the lack of wine might be a factor."
5,5,5,5,These folks are top notch.  They pay attention to details and it all is noticeable.  Anthony makes things happen that enriches ur experience.  Jamie attended to our every need.  This is a place you cannot afford to pass by.   The chef creates phenomenal creations and your palette will be amazed.   Been here numerous times and to tonight on our 36th wedding anniversary no different!  Bravo and we will see you again real soon!
4,4,3,4,"It has been a long time since my wife and I last visited SRI.  While we had a terrific evening overall, we are rating this as     鈥淕ood鈥.  There are some points of interest we would like to bring to the proprietor and chef.  First...while the waiter was exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable of the dishes, my wife and I thought it was rather odd that after mentioning each of the appetizers the price was quickly rattled off.  As the prices ranged from $16-$125, I think it would be better to prepare a daily tear-sheet to include inside the menu due to pricing variances. Second, another waiter came to the table to perform our bread service.  He started off by saying 鈥渋t looks like from what we have left... we have a whole wheat multigrain and multi seed bread鈥.  Wow!  This is not something to expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  As we are dining in a French cuisine restaurant it would be nice to include warm bread or freshly baked French baguette鈥檚...just a thought.  This bread was something u could get in Shop Rite or Whole Foods. Thirdly...attention to small details.  Keep water glasses filled,  had to ask 2x for refills.  Now let鈥檚 get on to the food.   Our appetizers were Szechuan noodles with beef and Tartare special.  Both were nicely prepared and flavors were very interesting. Nice contrast to the ground beef and peanut sauce in the noodle dish.  Would trim back on scallions a tad.  My wife loved Tartare.I had the Maribar Filet with beautifully prepared and seasoned with shallot mashed. Also we shared A foraged mushroom side dish which was out of this world!!  My wife had the Salmon. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Tender and fresh. Green beans were 鈥渃ommon鈥 - nothing special about them. There was no potato鈥檚 or starch. A little skimpy- considering the bread was earful. Desert was a shared buttermilk cake with apricot compote.  My wife liked this more than I...little boring.  We were also given 2 chocolate cookies from pastry chef.  Eh."
5,5,5,5,"I heard about the Inn  but never had a chance to visit it until this weekend.  The staff was polite and friendly, the food was absolutely fantastic and there was no rush enjoying our meal.  I will definitely be back again."
5,5,5,5,The food is so great here. The hamachi appetizer was perfection as well as the truffle mash. Scallops were so perfect too. Great time and great food. Love the interior.
5,5,5,5,"awesome ambiance, great food, top quality service - simply one of the best in Bergen County"
3,3,4,4,Portions were very small. 2 crab dishes were not expected in a tasting menu. Was a little disappointed.
5,5,5,5,"All courses memorable, especially the roasted Scottish salmon w/sourdough crust and rabbit & pork pate` with garnish and hummy desserts"
5,3,5,4,"Shrimp was over cooked (tough and crunchy), and the salmon was dry. NOT good!"
5,5,5,5,"This was our first time dining at Saint Jacques. We went to celebrate my husband鈥檚 birthday and everything was wonderful.  The food, the service, everything.  It was the perfect meal for a nice quiet celebration just the two of us. Lovely atmosphere and divine food!  My husband noted this was the best meal he had eaten in a very long time."
5,5,5,5,"This was one of the best experiences I've had.  The food, service, and environment was all wonderful."
5,5,5,5,"What an amazing restaurant. Here is a gem tucked between a barber shop and Harris Teeter in a mall!!  We were in Raleigh on business and really hit the jackpot with our choice. My spouse had the frog legs and declared them the best ever. I had the chef鈥檚 take on shrimp and grits with julienned duck as a garnish (and included a duck sauce). The shrimp was so fresh, it was like it had just come out of the sound.  Wonderful service. We will be back when we鈥檙e in town again"
4,5,5,3,"Amazing French recipies and flavors.a real taste of the French gastronomy for sure. So sorry to ecknoledge that location, decoration are ligthing are really poor. It clearly ruins all romantism and French cachet to be as brillant as the cuisine."
3,2,5,5,I've been here several times but tis last time the food wasn't as spectacular as other times. The Coquille was cold and didn't have a good amount of seafood. The onion soup is better in a lot of t=other restaurants that are not French. The pate' wasn't flavorful and the apple Tartin seemed mushy and unbalanced. I suppose every place has an 'off' night but all the dishes were off and that makes me wonder if I want to gamble a hundred on it again.
5,5,5,5,Amazing and rare find. The chef and waiter were both too notch. Food is authentic and great! Highly recommend.
3,3,5,4,"It was a nice place, but quite pricey for what we got. Wine starts at $50 bottle.  There were some nice touches but the meal was not worth what it cost. Food was good but nothing we'd hurry back to eat again."
5,5,5,5,Took my significant other here for her birthday as this is her favorite Raleigh restaurant. Food drinks鈥 and service were excellent.
3,3,3,4,It was so so.......................................Will not go back...........
5,5,5,5,Food and service were excellent! Only wish for a bit more of entree portion.  Dessert is to die for.
5,5,5,5,My go to restaurant for any special occasion. Great food great service. I never get tired of going to st Jacques
5,4,5,5,"A very enjoyable place for fine dining.Wait staff was friendly and fun, and attentive.Food was delicious."
5,5,5,4,Everything is as close to perfection as you鈥檇 expect.  We love the commitment to using local ingredients and products. An appearance by Chef Serge is always a special moment of the meal. Always a great experience
2,2,4,3,We have dined at St Jaques numerous timess over the years and every year on our Anniversary. We will break this tradition for our next Anniversary.  The dinner with wine and tip was around $300. I had the short rib and my wife the scallops. My wife thought the scallops were unfresh and she experienced significant stomach upset the next day. I had the beef short rib and it was inferior to that I have had at Coccquets in Raleigh. It was dry and not very tastefull . We could of done a better job on this dish in our own kitchen.  For dessert my wife had the creame brulett which was ok and I had the fruit tart which was marginal. What has happened to this restaurant?  it used to be something really special. I doubt this dining establishment stays in business much longer given the poor quality in the work of its Chef. i use the term"Chef" loseley.
5,5,5,5,"Saint Jacques is always one of our favorite places to dine for special occasions, and this visit did not disappoint. Everything was PERFECT, from the wine to the food to the service. We are always made to feel so welcome and appreciated whenever we visit, and it鈥檚 this level of personal attention and dedication to the craft of spectacular food that will keep us coming back!"
5,5,5,5,"The four of us had a delightful evening, enjoying excellent appetizers, main courses, and desserts, along with wines from a well-thought-out list.  We nearly recreated our experience dining at chef Serge's restaurant he once ran in Paris.  Well done!"
5,5,5,4,Wine dinner.
5,5,5,4,"Zevi was our waitress and was fantastic.  Friends from Canada and Dallas.  Two had the sweetbreads and said they were the best ever.  One of which is a French Canadian and dines in Quebec frequently.  Even had a chat in French with the chef.  My short ribs were off the charts!  On,y down side was they didn鈥檛 have Crown Royal and my buddy is good for at least 4 Crown Royal manhattans per dinner."
5,5,5,5,"I鈥檝e eaten here five times over the last 2 years. Every time I leave I think to myself, 鈥 when can I come back?鈥  In my opinion this is the best restaurant in Raleigh.  The service is impeccable and the food is always delicious.  It鈥檚 French cuisine so if your not familiar with French food don鈥檛 pass this gem by based on that. There is something for everyone."
5,5,5,5,"We have dined at Saint Jacques twice and both times the menu was superb, the plate presentation was beautiful and every item that we chose on the menu both times was fabulous. The other night, my soup of the day was a mouth watering cream of curried squash bisque and Beef Bourguignon which was superb to the palate. My husband had the fresh Snapper and a French Onion Soup Saint Jacques style. Two days later we are still talking about how fabulous the meal was. Desert can't be topped as I had a squash / chocolate cake which had a wonderful fall spice twist to it and my husband loved his classic, beautifully made Cr猫me br没l茅e."
5,5,5,5,"This was our first experience at Saint Jacques. It was truly an amazing experience. The service by ALL was attentive. The Chef delivered a scrumptious sweet potato foie gras and visited with each guest. He shared details regarding our delicious dishes and took pride in his staff. The attention to detail was beyond expectations. We most definitely recommend Saint Jacques to anyone who wants to experience an exquisite meal and be spoiled in the mean time.  As I mentioned to the Chef, this is a memory that I will treasure."
5,5,5,5,This place was what you want in a great dining experience
5,5,5,4,"I had lunch here after having attended a wine dinner in Durham the previous night and staying overnight in Durham (I live in Fayetteville, NC.)  For my first course I had a cup of the butternut squash bisque which was the special soup of the day and it was rich, creamy and delicious.   The glass of Vouvray was nice with the bisque.   My entr茅e was beef bourguignon which was also quite rich and delicious.  I had a glass of a Cote du Rhone with the beef and it was okay but not exceptional.  Service is always topnotch at Saint Jacques and the setting is relaxing and an oasis in a busy shopping center."
5,5,5,5,"Our waiter, Jonathan, created us and took care of all our needs. The Chef stopped by to meet us and to explain the special items on the menu. The food was outstanding and came at a perfect pace.The Birthday addition to the profiteroles was very nice. Even the cappuccino was perfect. There was a very good number of other diners but the noise level was 鈥渧ery quiet鈥. Looking forward to our next dinner at Saint Jacques!!!"
5,5,5,5,"Our evening at Saint Jacques with close friends was perfect from start to finish.  The cuisine was superb, the wines were outstanding, and the service could not have been better."
5,5,5,5,I have a red meat allergy (Alpha-gal) so Chef Serge came out and spoke with me and made adjustments to the sauce for the duck breast.  Very personal touch and very delicious.   We will be back as so as we can.
5,5,5,5,Always a great experience.  Serge takes great care of his guests and his menu outstanding.
5,5,5,5,"A great meal, great service. We have eaten here a number of times and we have never been disappointed. A great menu with great presentation. We would highly recommend to anyone looking for a top French menu."
5,5,5,5,"70th Birthday for my husband.  Ambience waspeaceful; no loud music, service professional,and food delicious.  Perfect."
3,3,3,4,Outstanding waitperson. Very slow order to food delivery.
5,5,5,4,"Wonderful food, service and experience!"
5,5,5,5,Had the rack of lamb and the grouper special.  Both were excellent.  Finished our meal with profiteroles.  A very nice evening!
5,5,5,5,Some of the best french food in the Raleigh areaExcellent presentation friendly and knowledgeable serviceThoughtful wine listOverall an outstanding experience
5,5,5,5,Awesome lunch!  Love the scallops and the crepe.
5,5,5,5,We were celebrating a special anniversary.  I think the servers and maitre de had as much fun with the special events and gift my husband had planned as I did.  Great evening.
5,5,5,5,We had an excellent time. The chef and waitstaff made us feel welcomed and were very gracious and forthcoming with information from the menu. Truly one of the best in Raleigh.
5,5,5,3,Terrific service... quality food..enjoyable but expensive lunch.
5,5,5,5,"Do not judge a book by its cover! It's located in a strip mall, but as soon as you step inside you'd never know. Great ambience, great food, great service!"
4,5,3,5,"Outstanding food. Truly the best sushi and sashimi my wife and I have ever had. The ambiance is great, dim intimate setting. Really awesome restaurant. The biggest issue was the service. Our server was quite good but the wait times were a bit ridiculous. Waiting 20 minutes for our first sushi roll to come out....and then my wife鈥檚 sashimi came out literally 15 minutes later (same course). The time we were there we spent 2/3 waiting for food and 1/3 enjoying the food."
5,5,5,5,Food is great! Service is outstanding. Moses and Kr
5,5,5,5,Always amazing Thursday night is duck night
5,5,5,5,Always a fan favorite!
1,1,3,1,Maybe I was expecting too much because of other good reviews. Maybe it was just an off night there. Either way I鈥檓 one and done. Sadly this was the worst sushi / Japanese restaurant experience I鈥檝e ever had. Food was lackluster overall and the nigiri was terrible. Got wagyu hot rock and the stone cooked two slices before cooling to much to do any good.
5,5,5,5,Great food and atmosphere!
5,5,5,5,"Always comfortable, friendly and good.Jan"
5,5,5,5,Excellent as always.
5,5,5,3,Wednesday night at 8 was very very busy at the restaurant. Food and service was good but it was a bit cold inside. Lighting could surely be better.
5,5,5,5,"Shinsei is a Dallas gem with amazing food. Get the black cod miso, maybe get 4. It鈥檚 the best thing on the menu. You won鈥檛 be disappointed with any of your choices"
1,1,1,1,"I made reservations at the recommendation of a co-worker since my daughter loves sushi and was looking for a special place to go before Homecoming. Dressed in their semi-formal attire and ready for an enjoyable dinner before the dance, they were greeted with the cold shoulder that a 17 year old couple sometimes gets assuming they will be immature and ill-mannered. Despite their best behavior upon waiting right under 30 minutes to even receive menus and water, they continued to be polite as my daughter finally caught the eye of the bartender who obliged. Unfortunately, he also had to take their order as wait staff came and went passing them by with complete disinterest. The food did come quickly once ordered, but all at once rather than progressively as hoped. The Miso soup was warm at best and the seaweed salad, volcano roll and oysters were just ok. Then came another long wait before having to finally ask about the steamed pork buns. They left dissatisfied, but still giving the traditional gratuity. I raised my daughter to always be kind, respectful and well behaved at restaurants. Now, I'm having a discussion with her about when to ask to see the manager. Extremely disappointed, we will take our cravings for sushi elsewhere for sure!"
5,5,5,5,"Everything about this restaurant was fantastic. There was an abundance of choices, the food was excellent, and the service was not only prompt, but very nice. It was a bit loud, but this aspect didn't hinder the rest of the experience."
4,5,4,5,Good experience at Shinsei. Didn鈥檛 wait long at all to be seated and the meal was excellent. The reason for four stars was because the birthday girl found a slug crawling on her while there. Not sure where it came from but it was pretty gross. Fortunately it was not in the food and we were sitting by an exit so it may have gotten in from the outside somehow but when we told our waiter he acted like it wasn鈥檛 really a big deal. Anyway the meal was great as expected and overall it was a good night.
5,5,5,5,They are always wonderful. From the moment you walk in until you leave.. they provide an exceptional experience
5,5,5,5,Everything was amazing! Love this restaurant!
5,5,4,4,Love it. Great food!!!
5,5,5,5,Great food and atmosphere
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding food, ambiance and service."
4,4,4,4,"great atmosphere, excellent food, fun place to go with friends, or meet new people at the bar"
4,4,5,4,we always love this place.  Drinks and food are wonderful
4,5,4,4,A little bit too dark for me.
5,5,5,5,Tammy is the best! But I bet you already know that. There鈥檚 no other like her!! :)
5,5,5,5,Birthday. Great food but pricey.
1,1,1,1,"Ordered 4 ordered or sushi to go and they never packed them along with my other leftovers. Spent order $350 on 2 people there and they wouldn鈥檛 even refund for the sushi they didn鈥檛 pack up. Spent what seemed like forever on phone with the manager who wanted me to account for each and every piece of missing sushi and still would not refund anything for the missing orders. Manager told me they do over $7m in sales and that was his justification for treating us so poorly. Was her birthday too and my friend wanted bring the sushi home to her son. Had pay for own dessert for her birthday, due to their only bringing out cotton candy and they don鈥檛 even say happy birthday. Food was not good either. No idea how they are that profitable."
2,3,2,3,Slow service
5,3,5,5,Amazing service. The server was super attentive and professional as well as friendly. Food was good. Trendy ambience. Felt like we were actually in a more cosmopolitan city.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful experience!!
5,5,5,5,Always fun and very tasty.  Our kids love the hot rocks and tempura green beans... and the obligatory cotton candy for dessert.  Bartender is always coming up with great drink options (for adults).  Sushi is always fresh and the staff is awesome!
5,5,5,5,Love Shinsei! The staff is so friendly and the food is delicious ALWAYS. One of my favorites!
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely the best sushi and environment in Dallas, if you are interested in a quieter location in the restaurant request upstairs seating, less kids."
5,5,5,5,"This restaurant has been consistently exceptional each time we've visited.  Our server, Casey, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, and guided us through the menu to make sure we experienced the best dishes the restaurant has to offer.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"
5,5,5,5,Excelent food!
5,5,5,4,"Great signature cocktails, delicious sushi and the fried rice is a must. The service at the bar and once we were seated was top notch."
4,4,5,4,"Food was delicious, as always!  The heirloom tomato salad was incredible!"
5,5,5,5,The experience was fantastic as always!
4,4,5,3,"We had a group of six and were given a table upstairs by the bathroom which was extremely noisy.  The music was loud and annoying and did not fit the atmosphere and downstairs ambiance.  It was disappointing as we had emphasized to our out of town guests many attributes of the restaurant, none of which proved to be true that night.  Our server Alfred was terrific, however."
5,5,5,5,Little loud but amazing.
4,5,4,4,The food was outstanding.if you鈥檙e looking for a great experience do not allow them to seat you in the outdoor patio .
3,5,3,4,Food is fantastic- however they rush you in and out so fast it is annoying for the price. Servers are knowledgeable and great - but we felt so rushed.
4,4,3,4,Service lacked attention to us but overall good.
3,5,1,5,"I鈥檝e had this waiter before and he is just horrible. It鈥檚 a young Asian man, and he always forgets everything! Forgets to let us know they are out of certain dishes, forgets to put in to go orders, forgets what we ordered.  The food in general is great and I always leave a good review for this restaurant, but this waiter is just terrible!"
5,5,5,5,"Quality, neighborhood, and service outstanding"
4,4,4,3,"Birthday dinner for boyfriend. The brought us a alive, yes I mean alive lobster on a plate that almost landed on my boyfriends lap. A little too much! But we appreciate the innovation"
5,5,5,5,Best experience!
5,4,5,4,Chidori is the best!
5,5,5,5,We love coming to Shu sushi! Best time
5,5,5,4,"Great food, lots of choices, wonderful neighborhood gem. Never disappoints. 馃槉"
5,5,5,5,Excellent service and the food is fresh and prepared to perfection!
5,5,5,5,"Terrific, as always!"
5,5,5,5,I鈥檝e never had a bad experience at Shu. The food and service are consistently good.
5,5,5,5,Love this sushi restaurant!High quality fish. Unique dishes. Amazing and attentive staff.
4,5,4,3,Noisy and expensive but delicious and fun.
5,5,5,5,"We have been coming Shu for years, ever since the Drago Group took over.I can honestly say it has to be among the 4 or 5 best in all of LA.Reservations are a must!"
4,5,4,3,Wonderful sushi.  The salmon was incredible.  Very fresh.  The server was attentive and helpful.
5,5,5,5,Always the ABSOLUTE best and gold standard of sushi and setting in LA!
5,5,5,5,"Love this place.  The food is excellent, the service is first rate and personal.  The ambiance is relaxed and friendly.  Always an enjoyable experience."

5,5,5,5,Excellent food and service
5,5,5,5,Great service and amazing food!!!
5,5,5,4,Great food!!!
5,5,5,5,Absolutely love this place!!!
5,5,5,5,Most recommended jewel of a restaurant
5,5,5,5,"So happy I found this place, sushi was fresh and amazing. Service was great and will definitely return for the amazing food."
5,5,5,5,Best meal as always!
5,5,5,5,"It's certainly not cheap, but it is well worth it. Specials and sashimi plates are the way to go. Uber fresh seafood of the highest quality, paired with spot on, unique flavor profiles makes this restaurants one of the best in the city. I love this place!"
5,5,5,5,Always the best and freshest sushi
4,5,5,4,I ordered several dishes and each were outstanding. Service was very good... efficient. I tend to prefer more space around me when eating however the food and service is worth the slightly cramped space.
4,4,4,3,"Food was very good, unfortunately the restaurant itself is very very noisy!"
5,5,5,5,"Delicious food, wonderful menu selections,  and excellent service as always"
5,5,5,5,Best sushi in Los Angeles.  We always love going to Shu.  Great neighborhood restaurant.  Friendly staff and excellent food.
5,5,5,5,Best Sushi in Los Angeles.  Period!!!  Everyone is incredible and the food is beyond amazing...
5,5,2,3,The service is amateurish and neglectful. It鈥檚 like the wait staff鈥檚 first day - every day! I eat here once a month for its fantastic food. And the service never gets any better!
5,5,5,5,Love the service and the food.
5,5,5,5,SHU offers some brilliant sushi concoctions with a subtle Mediterranean influence.  I have been going here since they opened and don't intend to stop.
5,5,5,5,"Great location, amazing sushi, good ambience..  perfect spot for lunch or dinner!"
5,5,5,5,Our go to sushi spot!
5,5,5,5,Every Sunday dinner
5,5,4,4,"It is good and it is consistent.  The fish is fresh and their preparations are delicious and artistic...  Its not inexpensive but it is one of the better upscale sushi spots in town.  The only minor negative is that it is a small space, so it is a bit loud and tables are close to eachother..."
5,5,5,5,"I took a dear friend to Shu for his birthday. A side by side banquette table awaited us. The staff couldn鈥檛 have been nicer. Our waitress was Shedara (sp) who is always a doll. Service was perfectly attentive.The food as usual was fantastic. We especially enjoyed the soft shell crab, tempura oysters and artichoke hearts of palm salad."
5,5,5,5,Salmon was generously portioned and cooked to perfection. Service was excellent.
5,5,4,4,"We booked weeks in advance to celebrate a 21st birthday.Unanticipated, the weather turned fierce, causing commute delays for the majority of our party of five. The staff was awesome at pushing our reservation back at the last minute.The food is always amazing and filling. Although we've not tasted anything yet that isn't delicious, the cappelacci in particular is to die for - - DO NOT MISS THIS DISH!As one of our appetizers, we enjoyed the grilled octopus, and it was magnificent!Our daughter was thrilled with her birthday dinner. Thank you for making her evening special."
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and service as always!
5,5,5,5,Dual Birthdays
5,5,5,4,Had a wonderful dinner with family. Tried a few things and shared them. Really liked the pork tenderloin.
5,5,5,5,Never leave disappointed! The short rib ravioli is my favorite. Finish off with the ricotta donuts. Yum
5,5,5,5,The service was excellent. The food was exceptional.Omg that bread!
5,5,5,5,Excellent place!  A little loud but everything else was perfect!
5,5,5,5,Visiting Cincinnati for the first time and this was the first restaurant we had seen on open table. Everything was great. Excellent service. Definitely would recommend for anybody visiting Cincinnati. Had the recommended short rib pasta dish and it was amazing!
4,3,5,2,"Appetizers were very good, cappelacchi was salty it would have been so good minus that. We also had the fusilli alla vodka with sausage. It was good but a little bland. Dessert , ambiance , and service were great! We will be back to try another dish!"
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful as always, great and friendly staff."
5,5,5,5,Great table - awesome service and the donut at the end!!
5,5,5,5,Engagement dinner was phenomenal!!
5,5,5,5,It was so great! Looking forward to dining at Sotto again soon hopefully!
5,5,5,4,"This place is amazing, I have never had a bad experience and it is my favorite place to go to celebrate a special occasion or to just have a nice dinner! We went here for our anniversary and had the best waitress! She recommended an excellent bottle of wine and even brought out our doughnuts with a candle on them for the occasion! Can't wait to come back again soon!"
5,5,5,5,"Went there for a week day lunch. The menu, service and prices were excellent."
5,5,5,4,Super people and great food.
5,5,5,5,The walk to the bathroom is scary.  But we love your restaurant.
5,5,5,5,Live in Indianapolis but really enjoy Sotto!
4,4,4,4,"The food was very good. The four of us all ordered different pastas so we could try several items.  They were all good, but we all agreed the cappellacci was the best!  The specialty drinks were really good too.We would recommend this restaurant."
5,5,5,5,"Sotto always exceeds expectations. Clinton was a great waiter that made recommendations that enhanced our meal. Can鈥檛 wait to go back! For starters we had the grilled octopus ragu along with the honey, goat cheese grilled bread. For dinner I had the cacio e Pepe and my husband got their new gnocchi dish which is unlike any gnocchi we鈥檝e ever had!"
5,5,5,5,"The ambiance is amazing! The food is phenomenal and the wait staff is the bomb, professional there when you need them and not bothering you when you鈥檙e chatting with your lunch partner. I love love love this place:)"
5,5,5,5,As always the food was fantastic and our waiter was extremely helpful!
5,5,5,5,Incredible food! Our waiter Nathan was fantastic. He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and recommended decadent dishes ! Can鈥檛 wait to go back again!
5,5,5,5,"This is the second time we celebrated our anniversary at Sotto. Our waitress Rachel was amazing at making our dining experience the highlight of our anniversary. The food, as usual, was out of this world. The Mezcal drink is delicious and a must have! Pictured below. Thank you Rachel. Josh & George"
5,5,5,5,Fantastic meal and even better service!
5,5,5,5,"I wouldn't call the noise level energetic, I would say it was hard to have a conversation it was so loud!"

5,5,5,5,Pleasant as always
5,5,5,5,It was great
5,5,5,5,Outstanding as always.  Such a consistent great menu. My favorite restaurant in Cincinnati
5,5,5,5,This is our 5th or 6th time at Sotto. We love it and always try and find a reason to come back!
5,5,5,5,Fantastic birthday dinner!
5,5,5,5,"Our service and food was fantastic as usual. We came before a show and the server was very attentive of our time restraints, which was much appreciated!"
5,5,5,5,One of the best restaurants not only in Cincinnati but in the US.
4,5,4,5,"Sotto's was probably the best Italian I have ever tasted.  That said, the prices were a bit high.  I would recommend it; I would just make them aware of the expense.  My only other comment was that I tried to schedule a reservation for 5 people and I was looking at two months out.  I finally had to change it to 4 and make it middle of week and even then Sotto's was booked a month and a half out."
5,5,5,5,"As always, Sotto is perfection. Creative cocktails, delicious food, impeccable service."
2,2,3,3,"Entrance was in much need of cleaning it up. Staff was friendly but the food was only OK.  I had a lunch portion of salmon and it was $20.00 and was not anything special. I had a glass of Gavi which tasted like it had been opened for a day or two. I have eaten at Sotto several times and always liked it. Maybe it was just an off day. I will give it another chance. However, they need to be careful since the competition is fierce in downtown Cincinnati; there are so many excellent places to eat."
5,5,5,4,"Very accommodating hostess...she was able to accommodate getting our group into a booth. This was important because our friend is unable to sit in hard surfaces. Also found out that there is an elevator that can accommodate one of our friends with disabilities. The food was excellent, as well, and the portions made in great for ordering multiple entrees and sharing them family style. The ricotta donuts and sauces were wonderful way to celebrate my birthday. Service was very much to our liking. Noise level (higher then needed) and lighting a little dim."
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, amazing service! We felt like the only one in the restaurant."
5,5,5,5,Excellent food
5,5,5,5,Possibly the best Italian food I've ever had. It was the perfect way to cap off a long weekend in Seattle!
4,5,4,4,Service was not great due to the fact that we had a late reservation and they were closing while we were finishing dinner. Our original server left.
5,5,5,5,"Classic, old school Italian (but no jackets or ties).  Well executed."
5,5,5,5,A wonderful dining experience.  We were blessed with the addition of delicate truffles added to an amazing fresh pasta with butter and sage. We enjoyed every bite of all four courses and our waiter was AMAZING!  She guided us to the happiest anniversary dinner we have had in years.
5,5,5,5,Best service in Seattle and the food is impossibly perfect every time.
5,5,5,5,Have dined here several times and it鈥檚 always outstanding in every way.  Will return soon.
5,5,5,5,Awesome in every aspect.
5,5,5,5,"Spinasse is one of our favorite restaurants in Seattle. The space is cozy, with a great bar and an open kitchen. The food is absolutely delicious; handmade pastas, amazing fish and lots of choices for vegetarians. Dessert is a must."
5,5,5,5,This restaurant never disappoints.  The whole experience is fantastic.
5,5,5,4,The pasta with butter and sage was amazing!  Great service.
5,5,5,5,Incredible food. Excellent and warm service
5,5,5,4,We ordered the 鈥渆verything on the menu鈥 menu option. For 105$/person it was a lot of food and a lot to take home. Everything was delicious.
5,5,5,5,"We had an amazing time. The food was spectacular, from the classic Piedmontese dishes (vitello tonnato, tajarin) to Chef Lane's own dishes (stuffed cipollini onions in brodo), everything was well-executed and delicious. The wine pairings were well-selected and generous. The meal was enhanced by the cozy atmosphere (and open-kitchen) and attentive service. It felt as if we were in Italy, enjoying a great meal mixing tradition with modern cuisine.  A definite must if you're looking to do a full celebratory meal, or event to just grab and aperitif and a bowl of pasta. We'll definitely be back!"
5,5,5,5,Great food and fun dining ambiance. It doesn't get any better than seeing the pasta being made in the back of the restaurant!
5,5,5,5,Perfect in every way.
5,5,5,5,"Ordered a number of dishes and shared amongst friends. Each dish was so carefully crafted yet simple. The pasta with butter and sage was to die for. Service was relaxed, unobtrusive and friendly. Great recommendations from our server. Would definitely return when I am back in Seattle."
5,5,5,3,Food is outstanding despite a very limited menu.  Prices seem high and you're crowded into tables with people on both side of your group.  But service and food make this worth a trip back.
4,4,5,4,"It was a little chilly sitting in the front corner next to the windows & near entrance.  One of our members needed to wear her coat during the meal.Service was perfect - checked in at appropriate times, offered reasoned opinions when requested, helpful with menu details.  Very professional yet relaxed and approachable. Most food was done exceedingly well.  Biggest miss was the Tajarin al ragu, the ragu was unremarkable.  We also tried the Tajarin con burro e salvia - both as menu standard and the one with truffles.  The sage with the truffles was over powering the flavor of the truffles.  We ordered several starters as well:  Antipasti Misto della Casa, Bruschetta, & Sformato.  All were excellent with everyone having their own favorites - the winner across the board was the Bruschetta.Overall it was a very enjoyable evening for all of us."
5,5,5,5,"On all counts, a lovely dining experience. The chef鈥檚 sampling selection of appetizers was simply exceptional. The service, superb."
5,5,5,5,"Number one spot in Seattle, for me. Love it."
5,5,5,5,"Amazing as always. My favorite restaurant in all of Seattle, hands down. Greatest staff, best chefs. Cannot be beat!"
5,5,5,5,Brilliant service. Loved it
3,5,4,4,"Food was fantastic although thought the portions were a bit smaller than expected. Again, everything we ordered was REALLY good. We were celebrating my friend鈥檚 birthday as I noted when I made my reservation.  It was my idea to bring him here and my treat. At the end of the dinner, my friend was brought a deer ornament with a candle on it. It created a good laugh but it was kind of insulting. Maybe just a 鈥渉appy birthday鈥 or nothing at all would have been better. Would return for the food but would probably go elsewhere when celebrating a special occasion. This is nothing to really complain about but Open Table seems to force a review out of you."
5,5,5,5,"First time in Seattle and first restaurant in which to eat after arriving from Chicago.  The restaurant is small and intimate.  Max, our waiter, handle the meal skilfully resulting in a very pleasurable experience.  The Sformato was out of this world. Thank you Max and thank you Spinasse."
5,5,5,5,"It was wonderful!Great food, great service.  Everything I wanted!"
5,5,4,5,The ambiance and the food was outstanding! It was everything we hoped for!
5,5,5,4,"We went there for our anniversary and had a lovely evening. Alisha was our server and she was fun and attentive, helping us with questions about the food and making excellent wine recommendations. All of the dishes we shared were outstanding with beautiful presentation. Not inexpensive but certainly worth it for a special evening!"
5,5,5,5,"Homemade pastas were divine. The brisket crostini was large with an incredibly flavorful cheese sauce,  and I wish I could eat it every day. The only miss in all of the dishes we tried was the shallot flan (too salty). Excellent service.  It feels like the neighborhood restaurant we all want to have."
5,4,5,4,"Good ambiance, great presentation. Food was a bit greasy and overly seasoned, but still enjoyed a good meal."
5,5,5,5,Spinasse food is amazing and the staff makes it special no matter how big or small the celebration is!
5,5,5,4,Wonderful food that was beyond our expectations鈥攁nd those were high.  The various sauces were truly magical in their depth and luciousness.  Things appeared deceptively simple but there was such attention to detail that each dish was unique and utterly delicious.  Service was also very good!  All around great experience.
5,5,5,5,Amazing Pasta and great service.  Great wine selection too.
5,5,5,5,Great experience. Excellent food.
5,5,5,5,"Great pasta, wonderful service - a must try in Seattle."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely wonderful from start to finish. Great service and mouth watering food. Highly recommend the butter and sage pasta.
3,3,3,3,We have dined at Spinasse several times and enjoyed the varied and imaginative treatment of Italian cuisine. This may have been an off night or a shoulder season situation but we found the entree menu selections too limited and skewed to meat. The steak ($46!!) portion was too large with "hunks" of beef dumped on the plate with various dried out accompanying items strewed around and the salmon similarly presented. A disappointing and expensive experience.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful service with amazing food.
5,5,5,5,Perfection! Other than kale that bordered on a salt lick. Easily forgiven as most meals here are enjoyed and close to perfect.
5,5,5,5,The pasta and service were amazing as always!!
5,4,5,5,Great tasting event. Wonderful winery to take visitors to and we enjoy going there on a regular basis.
5,5,5,5,We did wine and food pairing . Outstanding food and wine . My daughter had dietary concerns and they were so accommodating. Highly recommend.
5,5,5,5,"The wine and food pairing at St. Francis is second to none! It was an innovative, locally-sourced menu with a wonderful assortment of great wine. Should not be missed! Make your reservations now!"
5,5,5,5,Due to the fires and power outages everyone cancelled but they still did the food and wine paring just for the 2 of us. It was wonderful couldn鈥檛 ask for a better experience! The food and wine especially the hostess鈥檚 made us feel at home.
5,5,5,5,"The St Francis wine and food pairing is a great experience. They serve 5 small-dish courses, each paired with a different wine. The two hosts explain about the wine, and what you should notice about how the wine and food taste together. There are two tables of 8 guests, so you get to meet other like-minded people in an intimate setting. The room is elegant, and looks out over the grape vines and hills in the background. We do this event once a year, and have never been disappointed!"
5,5,5,5,I've never been disappointed!Everyone should experience this one of a kind wine and food pairing!
5,5,5,5,Best experience in SonomaBest special occasion in Napa/Sonoma.
5,5,5,5,Amazing. We did the wine and food pairing. Was a lot of fun!
5,5,5,5,"We've been going for 6 years, Absolutely unparalleled in Sonoma County/Santa Rosa area for winery wine paring lunch quality and value. DO NOT miss this!"
3,5,2,3,"We鈥檝e been members at St. Francis for 8+ years. We love the food and wine experience and we are excited for it every year. However, we were disappointed with the facilitators this year. When they showed up in jeans with their hair in messy buns, their appearance seemed mismatched with the experience. There were also servers in jeans and yoga pants. We highly recommend this event to everyone we know and now we鈥檙e second guessing it. We hope St Francis will match the presenters to the experience in the future."
5,5,5,5,It was a delightful experience!  The explanation of the wine and food pairing was so informative; it motivates you the experiment with other wines and food to create your own pairing.  We will be back.Of particular note are the two hostesses who by their expert presentation makes this a learning and fun experience!
5,5,5,5,The most delightful dining experience ever!!!!
5,5,5,5,Best wine and food pairing we've participated in. We would highly recommend this event to anyone looking to try great wine and food.
5,5,5,5,"My lifetime (we met in grade school) friends came to visit.  For one week we went everywhere: SF the city, Tahoe, Napa, Sonoma.  But the highlight of the trip was our visit to St. Francis.  We enjoyed every minute, every taste: from the friendly greeting with a glass of Chardonnay to the last bite of the food/wine pairing.  What a day.  What incredible food. What great wine. A special thanks to the St. Francis staff. Can't wait to visit again."
5,5,5,5,By far the best wine and food pairing.  The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.  Chef Trevor continues to knock it out of the park with his food. We visit twice a year and always recommend to family and friends.
5,5,5,5,The food and wine pairings were excellent.  Beautiful setting and excellent introductions of each wine.  Easily the highlight of our visit to Sonoma.
5,5,5,5,The wine paring experience was wonderful.  The staff could not have been better.  The Chef prepared a terrific ensemble of food to compliment the delicious St. Francis wines.  We will be back to experience another fabulous paring.
5,5,5,5,"Every time I return they've outdone themselves yet again!  Okay, that's true.  But with the presentation of each course, it seems the meal keeps getting better and better too.  I love their fresh vegetables from their garden, always seasonal.  This time, the first surprise was fried SMELT--who knows smelt on the west coast?  It was a delicacy, though I was raised on it and hadn't eaten it for about 40 years and it was fabulous, something I hope they cycle through their menu.  But that's what makes it amazing--Chef is always changing, always keeping things fresh, to keep beautiful pairings with the current wines.  And the wines are always the stars of the show, in spite of how fabulous the food is.  They work so well together, never just an after thought as a pairing.  I love going back once or twice a year to see what's on the plates.  This is a paired food/wine that you don't want to miss!"
5,5,5,5,A great place to take friends who are visiting wine country.
5,5,5,5,"What an incredible experience.   Totally enjoyed this.  The food , the space, & our educators were best of the best.  Beautiful Winery.   I would highly recommend ."
5,5,5,5,Wedding Anniversary
5,5,5,5,"St. Francis food and wine pairing was the highlight of our Napa weekend. Chef Trevor was fantastic as wine was paired perfectly. The moon cheese fondue was all of our favorites that we need to buy it. We really wanted to go back and do it again for dinner. Hint hint - have a dinner! The only bad thing was you can only go 11, 1 or 4."
5,5,5,5,The best food in Sonoma!  We鈥檝e been members for 10 years and it just keeps getting better. Their wines are outstanding as is the food
5,5,5,5,This was a pre-planned must-do & it was everything we hoped for!
5,5,5,5,Excellent experience!! We enjoyed so much. Would definitely do again
5,5,5,5,The food that was paired with the wine was amazing. It was a beautiful vineyard. One of our favorite things we did while in Sonoma for 5 days!
5,5,5,5,Pairing with Wine
5,5,5,5,We had a great time! The wine and food is amazing!!
5,5,5,5,We did the food and wine pairing on recommendation of my parents who did this 5 years prior for their 30th anniversary. It 100% lived up to the hype! The food was amazing and the wine incredible. I don't normally enjoy dry red wines but their dry reds have no bitterness or bite and are incredibly smooth and complex. We loved it and would 100% do it again!
5,5,5,5,"This is a wonderful, intimate experience, 16 seats total.  A very creative tasting menu driven by the great wines at St. Francis.  You will meet new people, eat delicious food and drink terrific wine.  The staff is super, you can tell they enjoy delivering this experience.  We take all our out of town guests to the food and wine pairing and all love it!"
5,5,5,5,I was treated very well on my big birthday!
4,5,4,4,"The food and wine pairing was exceptional, I could even say faultless and one I would highly recommend."
5,5,5,5,Celebrated Wedding anniversary with friends. Loved the small plate food and wine pairing!
5,5,5,5,"Our third wine & food pairing, and this one was the best!"
5,5,5,5,One of the most memorable experiences I have had. The food and wine pairing is exquisite and well worth it.
5,5,5,5,"Above and beyond what was expected, the St. Francis food was as good as the best restaurants anywhere. The pairings were spot on. This was a pleasant surprise for us and we doubt anyone would be disappointed."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely loved the wine good pairing.The hosts were great and the food was outstanding.
5,5,5,5,"I adore the food and wine pairing!  This was my fourth time, and it was so special as we brought our daughters.  Thank you.  We will be back again."
5,5,5,5,Great food and wine tasting experience!Need I say more?
5,5,5,5,Outstanding food and wine pairing
5,5,5,4,Outstanding service and food
5,5,5,5,"We鈥檙e fortunate to have sat at the bar for dinner again. Bruce is the consummate bartender.  He鈥檚 attentive, knows the menu and his wines, and is an excellent conversationalist. Hope the owners know what an excellent ambassador he is for the establishment!"
5,5,5,4,Had a wonderful meal and service was great . Cookie even came over to our table to say hello. We were celebrating a birthday ordered a dessert and was told it was on the house compliments of Cookie. Perfect way to end the wonderful meal.
4,4,4,3,Service was good and the chefs selections were enough to choose from
5,5,4,5,"Great food and wonderful location. The service was a little slow, but overall would highly recommend!"
5,5,5,5,Food was fabulous and the service was great. I highly recommend
5,5,5,5,The food is always consistently wonderful as it the bartending.  The music provided is incredible and that is why my family and I enjoy returning frequently.
5,5,5,5,Everything there is always excellent & consistent! I鈥檓 sure Cookie always being there to check on things has something to do with it.
5,5,5,5,Ala great meal even if cookie never says hello
5,5,5,5,Best bronzino I ever had
5,5,5,2,The food was great as usual and it was matched by the service.
5,5,5,5,Outstanding as always
5,5,5,4,Amazing dinners-could not be any better.I cannot wait to return.
5,5,5,5,Excellent evening with my wife
2,2,4,4,It鈥檚 gone down hill....
5,5,5,5,"Never disappoints.  Always great in every way. The menu changes and is delicious.  We were a table of eight, ordering different dishes and everyone was happy.  Service was attentive and friendly."
5,5,5,5,Continues to be one of the best in all of NJ not just South Jersey. Nice atmosphere. Flawless service. Great craft cocktails and wine list. All the food was prepared perfectly. Wife stuck with Jersey Shore staples like clams and a lobster. I went with a spicy mussel app and nut crusted halibut. All great. We have now been to this wonderful restaurant over a dozen times and it never disappoints.
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic birthday dinner celebration - great food from appetizers, entrees, sides, and dessert. Beautiful ambiance."
5,5,5,5,"Never a disappointment. Everything was wonderful as usual. The ambiance, the food, the staff and the selections of both the wines and entree selections were fabulous! Consistently wonderful!"
5,5,5,5,Steve and Cookies is always wonderful! The food is always delicious and the service is always great!
5,5,5,5,The waiter Anthony was phenomenal
5,5,5,5,Always great food and service!
5,5,5,5,Food always first rate. Three course nightly specials  during the fall and winter are a special treat.
5,5,5,5,Always a great meal !
5,5,5,5,"Celebrating the purchase of a new family house, 27th wedding anniversary and the Nationals winning the world aeroes"
5,5,5,5,Fantastic! Always a seamless experience!!
5,5,5,5,Everything was to perfection as always!
5,5,5,5,I have been to restaurant over 100 times- every meal is better than the last. Never had a less than great meal. Outstanding!
4,5,4,4,"We happened to be in the area for the weekend and had friends staying with us to celebrate their anniversary. Food was outstanding and not being charged for the dessert was very nice and considerate. It was very crowded but still more pleasant than dealing with summer crowds and noise.Only negatives were that (1) we were freezing cold in the room in which we ate, although other rooms were not cold and we asked the server if he could perhaps get the A/C adjusted and (2) my friend was charged $5.00 for a few pieces of steamed broccoli because she could not get a substitute for mushrooms, which she could not eat because of an allergy."
5,5,5,5,We go to Steve and Cookies for special occasions and it always is a very good choice.
5,5,5,5,"Always a very good experience! Glad Cookie added some new pasta dishes to the menu, they were great!"
5,5,5,4,We had a very nice time.  The food and service were great and the complimentary birthday dessert topped off the dining experience.
5,5,5,5,Always a wonderful dinner at Steve & Cookie鈥檚. Our waiter Dan was  wonderful!
3,3,5,4,Overrated.  Food was good. Service was excellent.  It was very noisy and unexceptional.
5,5,5,4,"The best at the shore - hands freaking down. Go here a couple of times a month (shore resident, not shoobie) and never tire of the delightful seafood preparations and wonderful desserts."
5,5,5,5,Always great food and great service
5,5,5,5,"Never disappoints! Food is consistently good, everything I have tried, and there has been many, has been excellent!"
4,4,3,4,Enjoyed a wonderful birthday! Food was delicious! Will definitely return to Steve and Cookie鈥檚
5,5,5,4,Another excellent dinner celebrating a family birthday.
5,5,5,5,It is great.  We love it.   The paella was delicious
5,5,5,5,"It was perfect.  A lovely fall evening, ambience, good food, great service.  We couldn't ask for more.  A special place on a romantic weekend."
5,5,5,5,60 th Birthday celebration
4,4,4,4,"We were seating near a party of 10, need I say more. A common problem that needs resolution. Also needless to say .... expensive but the romance of arrival at night is worth the price of admission."
5,5,5,5,"Same high standards, wouldn鈥檛 know that they ever had any damage"
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, fabulous service and an incredible outdoor patio."
5,4,5,5,"Great! An enjoyable time had by all. A little overpriced for lunch as there was not much choice for Vegetarians. 75 Dollars a head is pretty steep for salads.Too many bugs.The service was great, atmosphere wonderful. Need better veggie dishes.Meat orientated."
5,5,5,5,Incredibly dining experience. The Ranch so is special.
4,4,4,5,"Food was vg.  Ambiance is elegant.  Wine list stupidly overpriced.  First time I ever ordered wine by the glass at this caliber.  Adrian, our server, was terrific.  Strangely - place was empty at 8 pm on Wednesday.  Wonder if it鈥檚 the wine prices?"
5,4,5,5,"Simply magical!!  Celebrating our anniversary and The Stonehouse was spot on for two evenings dining perfection.  Everything from the lanterns that grace your path up the stone walk entrance, to the warm, inviting & tasteful decor, to the twinkling candlelight, fireplace, and barely discernible music, to the impeccable service and beautifully prepared dinner.  It was so lovely!  I am especially picky about dining atmosphere, and I can honestly say there is no detail that Stonehouse management and staff has not  thought through and delivered.  I forgot what a difference a truly professional waitstaff can make to your dining experience. The blood orange margaritas and the Thai coconut sauce served on rice and grilled tofu were a couple of our favs."
5,4,5,5,"An experience. First the natural beauty to the place is beyond. The food is stellar, though I ordered from the vegetarian menu, it was quite fresh and delicious. Wine offerings were tremendous and the sommelier extremely helpful"
5,5,5,5,"I'm thrilled to have learned that this amazing gem of a restaurant has reopened after being reconstructed following the fire and floods in the Santa Barbara area.  Elegant, cozy, with a fabulous ambience, The Stonehouse will transport you to another level of dining. Wonderfully prepared food, graciously perfect service, cozy indoor dining with a fireplace or a lovely outdoor patio, your pick. There's even a lovely adjacent lounge for a post lunch or dinner cognac and conversation. Simply wonderful!"
5,5,4,5,Beautiful setting and delicious food!!!  Can't wait to come again!
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I celebrated our 33rd anniversary, and had a glorious time. Our Dutch waiter, (a surprise countryman,) was wonderful made us feel like royalty, and even surprised us with a personalized desert! The food was exceptional, and the atmosphere just terrific. We won't forget that evening!"
5,5,5,5,Beautiful evening.  So fortunate to share it with out of town guests.  Thank you!
5,5,5,5,Absolute fairy tale evening. I recommend this to anyone who would love a quiet intimate evening with amazing cousins only bested by the supreme service from the moment we drove through the gate till the valet retrieved our vehicle. I鈥檒l be back for years to come
5,5,5,5,Anniversary
5,5,5,5,"We LOVED every minute and bite.  We don't frequent this fancy a place often but it was a special anniversary and birthdays.  Dan was our waiter and he was wonderful, very sincere and helpful and very relaxed.  We WILL be back for another birthday.  Thanks again and thanks to Dan .Chris and Joy Jordan, Boulder, Co."
5,4,5,5,Beautiful experience during our baby moon. Everyone was wonderful.
5,5,5,5,"Beautiful setting, impeccable service, A+ food"
5,5,5,5,"We had lunch here last week. The setting is so beautiful that even a mediocre meal would have been worth the visit. But the food is not mediocre, it's top notch.  I had the nicoise salad, with perfectly seared tuna and fresh tasty vegetables, subtly dressed. Pair that with a nice glass of white wine and you've got heaven on earth."
5,5,5,5,"One of our favorite restaurants ever. In fact I think it is top 5 in the USA we鈥檝e ever experienced. Service A+, atmosphere spectacular & classy. Food came out very promptly. As always superb!Cheers"
5,5,5,5,"My husband and I went out for a special dinner. Was it ever special!  Possibly the best service I鈥檝e EVER received, and the food was fantastic. It was very expensive, but I was expecting that so it wasn鈥檛 a shock. Absolutely loved it!"
5,5,5,5,"30th Anniversary dinner. Fabulous restaurant, impeccable service and delicious food."
4,4,4,5,"We had a lovey evening at Stonehouse. I was looking forward to seeing the Ranch and experiencing the beautiful patio for dinner. It certainly lived up to expectation in terms of ambiance. However, we had a couple missteps along the way. I ordered a cocktail at the lounge and my husband asked for water. I got my cocktail within minutes鈥 his water never showed up and we weren鈥檛 able to flag down a staff member for the rest of the time in the lounge. Finally, a server swung by to tell us our table was ready. We had a lovely meal on the patio and enjoyed the fresh vegetables from the garden immensely. The lamb was cooked perfectly, but the octopus was pretty terrible鈥 clearly cooked too long at too low a temperature. We鈥檙e not super food snobs, it was just disappointing for an overall sublime meal. Dessert was delightful. We left happy and satiated. But we probably won鈥檛 be dying to come back anytime soon."
3,2,4,5,Such a gorgeous setting but the food is mediocre and very disappointing.
4,3,3,4,Nice ambience. Food not up to par with expectations and pricing. Lamb overcooked and halibut dry. Cheese selection was good as was house wine. Would not return. Wait staff overly friendly as though soliciting gratuity and food explanation rather robotic. Suggest a service overhaul.
5,5,5,5,"Everything about the Stonehouse restaurant is the highest quality the food, service and ambiance makes this a special place for a celebration.  Our server was so sweet to even pack the pastries for the ride back to San Diego.  Take the time to walk through the gardens, they are beautiful."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful !
4,3,4,4,The service was great; the food was enjoyable but nothing to write home about. The location of the ranch and the restaurant was fantastic. Because it was open air there were some little flies around but not too bothersome.
5,4,5,5,Special night.
5,5,5,5,"Totally wonderful, food, service and atmosphere. Definitely a return visit location."
4,3,4,5,"I'd recommend Stonehouse with some caveats.  We visited for brunch this time - three courses for $75 with unlimited beverages, including Prosecco and Champagne.  This is actually a good value if you're extremely hungry and you enjoy drinking a lot of Champagne.  The food, however, is unremarkable. We found the same at dinner here years ago.  Everything is well made, but has a sort of ""I could make this at home"" quality.  Beautiful setting, however, and excellent service."
5,5,5,5,Always the best brunch!!! Service is great too! The Ranch has beautiful grounds and you can really relax and enjoy.
5,5,5,5,"Stonehouse is truly one of the best restaurants in the world. The service, food, dessert, wine list, ambiance is incredible. This was our fourth visit and we will be back!"
5,5,5,5,Everything was perfect.  Richard was wonderful!  Magical place!
5,5,5,5,"Had an amazing time, Ling Ling was our server and she was amazing. Would definitely recommend to others. We will be back to try out dinner next time!"
3,3,5,5,Food was good but not great and overpriced. Ambience was nice.
5,5,5,5,A special place for a special occasion
5,5,5,5,"The service, the food and the ambience were outstanding. A really lovely place to dine."
5,5,5,5,It is a beautiful place with delicious food and our wait person Antonio was terrific!
5,0,0,0,"Great service, even better food. The best sushi in New York easily, if not America. Try it at least once and it will change your perspective on food entirely."
3,5,4,3,"After watching Jiro dreams of sushi and the fact that Nakazawa now has a star, my expectations going into this meal we鈥檙e very high. While many pieces were tasty, for the price there are better omakase experiences in the city. Exceptional attention to detail is lacking. Moths flying around the bar and Ikea cabinetry take away from what should be a refined experience. The publicly in the press seems to draw tourists rather than local regulars."
5,5,5,5,Best sushi of my life. Cried when it was over
5,5,5,5,Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and it was fantastic.  Everything from the food to the ambiance was fantastic.  Can鈥檛 recommend Sushi Nakazawa enough.
5,5,5,5,Great food and great experience
5,5,5,5,"Such a great experience. Service was friendly, attentive, and thorough. The sushi was some of the best I've had. Will definitely come back again."
5,5,5,5,Melt in your mouth sushi! First class service. Bar seating is a must for full details of all you are eating. Awesome experience. Perfect sushi lover birthday dinner.
5,5,5,5,Extraordinary
5,5,4,5,Lasciate da parte tutto per un paio di ore e concedetevi questa straordinaria esperienza. Il conto 猫 alto ma laQualit脿 non 猫 da meno. Se volete un vero ristorante happiness andateci
5,5,5,5,Fabulous in every way. You must love sushi and respect the artist at work.
2,1,3,1,"it doesn鈥檛 worth for the price paid, the omakase had no surprise , just ordinary sushi to me & too rush the time锛"
5,5,5,5,"Our 50th bdays celebration was well noted. We got some extra un铆 and bday candles in our lychee sorbet! Missed Nakazawa San, but didn鈥檛 expect to see him on a Monday. A great special occasion place that spoils sushi eating anywhere else."
5,5,5,5,Lugar excepcional . uno de los mejores Susi que he comido
3,4,2,3,Food itself is high quality and sake also very tasty. Delicious. But somehow doesn鈥檛 match my expectation. Chef seems not pay attention enough.
5,5,5,5,Another super high end experience
5,5,5,5,"La miglior cena a base di sushi della mia vita, una delle migliori cene in assoluto.Dimenticate i pur buoni uramaki fusion e colorati di alcune rinomate catene milanesi.Qui c'猫 la pi霉 pura tradizione del sushi in forma di nighiri. Non dovete scegliere nulla, solo sedervi al bancone (possibilmente, perch茅 猫 certamente pi霉 interessante di una cena al tavolo), guardare i  maestri al lavoro, ascoltare il nome del piatto in giapponese, prontamente tradotto in inglese dalla cameriera alle vostre spalle e poi gustare ad occhi chiusi.OK, non 猫 cheap, ma non 猫 neanche un ristorante qualsiasi. Il servizio 猫 di alto livello e la qualit脿 eccezionale. Nessun serata al giapponese sar脿 pi霉 la stessa, dopo questa esperienza!"
5,5,5,5,"The sushi bar was a fantastic experience. Every piece of sushi was unbelievable, the sake carefully selected and the service was impeccable. I was worried it might be a bit stuffy but everyone was so kind and welcoming. It was truly memorable."
5,5,5,5,"Exquisite omakase experience, the food & service is excellent and the attention to every detail is truly impressive."
5,5,5,5,Terrific and unique experience to sit at the bar and enjoy a curated 20-course dinner.
5,5,5,5,"EVERY SINGLE TIME we come here, we are transported, healed, fed and showered with the best attention.This is food as art in its highest form.We are extra grateful to Chef for remembering us and welcoming us and to Anthony Arvin for the spectacular wine journey on Monday night. THANK YOU THANK YOU! We cannot wait to come back."
5,5,5,5,Incredible experience! It was delicious. Must visit for Japanese food lovers. The best sushi me and my friend ever had. Will back definitely.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful. Best sushi experience ever
5,5,5,5,Great sushi with acceptable omakase pricing.
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding in every sense of the word ! Felt transported  to some exotic place in some far corner of the world , yes Tokyo!  The sushi was simply delicious, I could go on forever , service beyond stellar , a fabulous evening , will definitely go back"
5,5,5,5,Could not love the experience more - despite the fact that
2,1,2,2,"Their food wasnt good, not even compare to other more price friendly restaurant."
5,5,5,4,Best tasting sushi I鈥檝e ever had in my life.  It was Semi mind blowing
5,5,5,5,Fantastic Sushi experience! Highly recommend this if you want a five star omakase experience from an experienced staff! We've been here many times and every single time is an amazing experience!  Wish we could post the entire course but definitely get any and all add-ons if you only plan on going here once!
1,5,1,5,"As a huge Sushi Nakazawa fan, I was more than excited to take my brother to lunch at the sushi bar for his birthday. I was lucky to eat here last year and had an absolutely fantastic experience - which made me even more dissapointed in my most recent experience. My brother has celiac disease, which can be an issue at other restaurants, but Sushi Nakazawa reassured us that accommodating his dietary restrictions would not be an issue - we made sure to call ahead of time, remind the host, and checked with our waiter twice. But unfortunately, within an hour after eating, my brother was extremely sick. We had the same exact meal and I was completely fine. When you're paying the prices that you do at Sushi Nakazawa, and have been reassured that they can handle customers with celiac, it's quite frustrating when they fail to do so. The next day I called the restaurant to let them know what happened and the host kindly said they would have management follow-up, but 2 weeks have passed and I haven't heard anything - not even an apology. Shocking when you expect high quality customer service from a restaurant of this quality. This truly is an amazing sushi restaurant, but if you have dietary restrictions, eat at your own risk."
5,5,5,5,As close to Japan as you will find in New York.  Innovative touches on fabulous traditional sushi.
5,5,5,5,"Mind blowing and Amazing Perfection in every bite, expensive but well worth it."
5,5,5,5,"I had 7pm dinner at the bar with my husband for our anniversary. Our dinner experience was first and foremost time well spent together, made sweeter by the cozy ambiance, tasty omakase, delightful tea, and thoughtful service. We enjoyed watching the chefs at work and our exchanges with the staff were brief. If this is the kind of thing your after, go for it. Looking forward to our next meal at Sushi Nakazawa!"
5,5,5,5,Food was great!
5,5,5,5,Nakazawa was everything we expected.  Could not have asked for a better experience.  Will be back again and again.
5,5,5,5,Really exceptional!
5,5,5,4,Really delicious
5,5,5,5,This was the best meal that I've ever had. The salmon was out of this world.
5,5,5,5,Arguably the best Sushi Restaurant in NYC. Delicious from start to finish!
5,5,5,5,My favorite place in the world. It鈥檚 a religious experience.
5,5,5,5,Late Valentine鈥檚 Day celebration. Wonderful food and atmosphere and knowledgeable staff.
5,5,5,4,"Overall comment is 鈥淲ELL DONE鈥! It was a wonderful anniversary celebration. We went all out and did the wine pairing menu. It was fantastic! We started with a complimentary celebratory Cava, and ended with a complimentary granola bar to take home for breakfast! This was a tasty surprise as the granola had a hint of chili that was understated and was probably the best granola we鈥檝e ever tasted! Highly recommend!"
2,2,3,3,"The price/performance is just not there.  $245 for two, without tip?  I went home and had a pbj sandwich.  Too precious by alot."
5,5,5,5,"Beautiful food, good wine, excellent service. Look forward to going again."
5,5,5,5,We were here for our anniversary  dinner. The food was great. Every course was delicately arranged and full of surprises. It was like your taste buds were exploring the world of cuisine. Staffs were really kind and also knowledgeable about the menu.
5,5,5,4,"Our first visit to The Table was in honor of my wife's birthday. From beginning to end it was a special experience. Our waitress, Felicia, was cheerful and friendly and ready to explain everything. We enjoyed her company through the evening. Our courses were served, however, by several other people in addition to her - a flexibility that avoided undue delay.  (At one point, however, we might have been impatient had we not been in such a good mood.) The food was exquisite. Since there were two of us, and two choices for each course, we decided to order everything.  Felicia suggested this also, though we'd already decided. It is really hard to determine favorites. Especially shared like this, we had a few bites of each choice and then went on to the next. The measure of a wonderful restaurant is those first few bites: after that, even at the best restaurants, additional morsels are just food. At The Table, we were at the highest register all evening long. While The Table is not cheap, it is not that expensive either, and a great value. I'm looking forward to going back."
5,5,5,5,Per usual the meal was incredible. Jesse crushed the wine pairings again. Can't wait to go back.
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely fabulous!  I took my entire family during our recent visit to Boston and everything was amazing.  The food was outstanding and our server was world class - helpful and attentive without ever being overbearing or pretentious.  We dined at 7 of Eater Boston's Top 10 during our visit, and everyone agreed that A Table At Season To Taste was deserving of its No. 1 Ranking."
5,5,5,5,Easily one of the best meals my father and I have ever had in our lives. We can't stop talking about it!
5,5,4,3,Outstanding as always
5,5,5,4,This was my fourth visit and it was amazing as always. Food and wine pairings were excellent. Service was attentive and knowledgeable.
5,5,5,5,"An incredible dinner experience. Dishes are creative, seasonal, boundary-pushing in the best ways, and always delicious. Preparation is consistently excellent. Service is welcoming, friendly, and knowledgeable. Also recommend the wine pairings -- they never fail to impress. Overall, one of the best dinners Boston has to offer."
4,5,5,4,"Our sons bought us a gift certificate for my wife's birthday to  go to Season to Taste. She is a nutritionist and a great cook, so she appreciated the great food. I liked it too. It is very expensive, but we had a great time.  One suggestion: Tell people that the meters on Mass Ave stop at 6 pm. It is helpful for planning for people coming from outside the city.  Thanks for a great experience! Kevin & Lynn O'Reilly"
5,5,5,5,"Excellent restaurant gastronomique in North Cambridge. Pricey, but worth it. Notable wine list."
5,5,5,5,"Our anniversary dinner was outstanding in every respect.  Four course prix fixe, for each course two choices. We ordered both and shared, and had the wine pairings.  So we each tasted 8 dishes and shared 8 different wines.  And, I think it is not an exaggeration to say that every dish was perfect."
5,5,5,5,My husband and I came here for my birthday dinner.  The food and service were excellent!  It is a quiet spot with great ambiance.
5,5,5,5,It was a treat to sit at the counter and watch the chefs prepare and plate their wonderful creations.
5,5,5,5,Restaurant is extraordinary in every way......best experience we've ever had......can't wait to return.
5,5,5,5,Delightful as always
5,5,5,5,AMAZING  start to finish. Very impressive service - our server was very knowledgeable about the wine pairing.
5,5,5,5,We had one of the most enjoyable dining experiences here that we have ever had ! Do yourself a favor and check this place out ! It鈥檚 fabulous .
5,5,5,5,This place is special. Wonderful cozy atmosphere and open kitchen with knowledgeable waitstaff makes all the difference. The food is absolutely surprising and delicious. Totally worth the price.
5,5,5,5,"The best place for an anniversary dinner. 2nd anniversary there and it lived up and surpassed the original! Delicious eggplant wontons in rabbit broth, short rib rigatoli, zucchini and kale in a red chili salsa - I could go on. Each course had something I was obsessed with - the honey chai ice cream, the fresh hearty bread in my salad with the garlic aioli, the housemade guac and shrimp on some sort of large chip. Service was also fantastic - Michael was informative and patient, and Felicia was an absolute delight to discuss the neighborhood with. Don't let the price scare you - this place is a once in a blue moon favorite."
5,5,5,5,"We love, love, love this restaurant! Small, intimate and wonderful food.I had the wine pairing with my dinner and it was spectacular.Excellent attention to detail and the wine choices absolutely complementing the food.Loved everything!!!"
5,5,5,4,Outstanding food served in a four course price fixed format with excellent options. Service staff could not be nicer and the small confines allow for you to interact with both the chefs and the wait staff. The wine selections for the pairing were spot on. A wonderful experience.
5,5,5,4,"One of my favorite places in greater Boston, Carl is the bomb"
5,5,5,4,Fantastic food and service. Each dish tasted fresh from the garden. The servers were very knowledgeable and you could tell that the employees were all passionate about the menu. Thanks for a wonderful birthday meal!
5,5,5,5,"Had a chance to sit at chef鈥檚 counter, which was a lot of fun, having the chefs present and describe each plate of food. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food was absolutely delicious. So much fun to watch Chef Carl & team at work"
5,5,5,5,"My husband and I came here to celebrate our one year anniversary. We had used Season to Taste to cater our wedding, so we were looking forward to another delicious meal. The food and service was both remarkable. Our waiter was so knowledge about the wines that paired well with the food. Every single dish was so fresh and all was very unique. If you go as a group of two, I highly recommend ordering one of everything on the menu!"
5,4,5,3,"Wonderful service. Interesting wines. Excellent food, but more heat (consistently) than we anticipated (in general we  like spicy food)."
5,5,5,5,"What an amazing place! The flavors in each dish was phenomenal. We love the food, people, atmosphere and company. Everyone should try this wonderful experience!Thank you!"
4,5,4,3,"Very delicious meal, accommodating to vegetarian preferences, warm and friendly service. Service was quite slow with long breaks between courses, and could have progressed a bit more smoothly. Also, it was a little strange after my wife ordered a vegetarian menu due to pregnancy concerns, she was still brought a raw oyster amuse, which is off-limits even if cooked - but the oysters were fantastic and I enjoyed both of them."
5,5,5,5,"We had a counter seating and it was such a fabulous decision. We were able to see the cooking and plating processes, which we were very excited with. It was such a fun. We ordered the whole menu to tried everything, not every dish was a hit for us, but the flavors, cooking to perfection and great taste balance was 100% there.  Loved the service, compliments from the chef. Definitely recommend this place to everyone."
5,5,5,5,We love to go to The Table at Season to Taste for special occasions.  The staff remembered what our preferences were and even had a couple of wine choices picked out for us based on previous selections. This restaurant is outstanding in all regards!
5,5,5,5,Outstanding. Simply outstanding.
5,5,5,5,Very cozy setting with amazing food.
5,5,5,5,"I gave my 16 year old son a gift certificate for Christmas to come here. He's in a local culinary program at school and I wanted him to have a ""chef's table"" kind of experience at a fine restaurant. The Table exceeded my expectations. We sat at the counter inches from the chefs and got to interact with them when they weren't too busy. Chef Carl Dooley talked about his own training with my son and invited him to stop by any time to help out with prep after school. My son was thrilled. The food courses were superb and varied, and the restaurant is perfect for that special meal. The tables are not too close to each other and the noise level just right for private conversation. Lovely booth in the front window for a party of 4."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful seasonal ingredients just like the name suggest. Truly was a taste of summer. Really enjoyed chef's creations.
4,4,5,4,Nothing too extraordinary just ok
5,5,5,5,Food and wine pairings were delicious.  Staff was very friendly and attentive.
5,5,5,5,Outstanding as always.  The August menu is a delight.  Looking forward to our next visit!
5,5,5,5,This was our second visit.Had brunch there a few months ago- excellent.Dinner was also excellent-Great service-Delicious food-Will definitely recommend to friends- and will be back
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic atmosphere, food and service. Great attention to detail by the staff all around."
4,3,5,5,"Atmosphere was great, service was perfect, food was okay.  Meatball appetizer was delicious.  The crab pasta had very little crab, and tons of heavy buttery sauce.  Pasta was cooked well, al dente, but overall not what I was hoping for."
5,5,5,5,"Double date with our best friends and had one of the best meals ever. Try the short rib, I鈥檓 going back for another one soon."
5,5,5,5,"Great food, great atmosphere. The drinks are awesome."
5,5,5,3,"First time at brunch here, absolutely loved the menu. The Donut Holes were fantastic, Mushroom Omelette unreal, Mediterranean Cucumbers were perfect, and a great Bloody Mary! Only complaint was how close the tables were together ... hard to have a conversation when having to focus so much to drown out the table next to you."
4,4,5,4,"Brunch is very good. Strong drinks! We had the 鈥渕unchkins鈥 which were perfect. Then the local brunch dish, cheesy eggs and homemade English muffins!  Crab Benedict which I wish had more crab on it. Servers are great too."
3,5,5,3,I have eaten at Talulas several times. Each time I loved the food but hated the noise. It never changes. So as far as recommending the restaurant I do but with caution about the noise level.
5,5,5,5,"Consistently delicious food, outstanding service.    I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion. If you could afford to go every weekend go for it.    We went for Sunday brunch at noon and it was a packed house. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Even though it was a little bit loud it鈥檚 to be expected at that hour of the day. We Enjoyed the mushroom omelette, and 鈥渕unchkins鈥 with Blueberry compote and lemon curd."
4,4,4,5,"Wonderful Sunday Brunch to celebrate a birthday. The drinks and food were delicious, especially the shrimp and grits! The eggs were some of the best eggs I鈥檝e eaten. If I had to draw attention to one thing it was the length of time it took to receive our 鈥渂runchatizers鈥. Other than that, food service and surroundings were great. Highly recommend."
4,5,5,4,Outstanding brunch.  So many choices.  Everything was delicious. We would definitely return and recommend it to others.
5,5,5,5,Thanks for another great anniversary brunch! Everything was perfect.
5,5,5,5,"The day of, We ended up wanting to add 2 additional guests to our reservation. Even though they were totally booked, they did us a huge favor and made it work for us! All 4 of us thought that the meal we got was the best we ever had!! The French toast bites were PHENOMENAL. And the omelettes were a perfect texture. The potatoes that accompanied the omelettes were so crispy and flavorful.  Talula鈥檚 has such a great, and unique menu! We already can鈥檛 wait to come back! Couldn鈥檛 recommend more!"
5,5,5,5,The food and service were amazing.
5,5,5,5,Always excited to dine here when in Philly.
5,5,5,5,This place was AMAZING! My girlfriend was in town visiting and we came here for dinner. Everything was perfect from the food to the drinks to the ambiance. I would recommend this place to anyone.
5,5,5,5,"This was our first time dining at Talula's Garden.  My husband and I were celebrating our 24th wedding anniversary and the wait staff brought us a complimentary glass of champagne, a cheese app and a dessert.  We started off with the international cheese board beautifully arranged on slate followed by braised short ribs and roasted duck and finished with the lavender donuts with lemon blueberry compote.  Everything was beautifully plated and equally scrumptious.  Thank you for a perfect evening.  We'll definitely add this to our hit list."
5,5,5,5,"It was wonderful!  Our waitress was so knowledgeable and friendly.  Food was amazing, and the ambiance very homey"
5,5,5,5,Amazing experience per usual. Never a bad dish at talulas. Also very helpful for selecting dishes for those who had allergies or food restrictions. Will be back soon
5,5,5,5,The chef鈥檚 tasting menu is absolutely awesome. IMO the  best offering in Stephen Starr鈥檚 collection in Philadelphia. I loved every dish in the chef鈥檚 tasting menu and couldn鈥檛 recommend it more for gourmands that appreciate fine dining and the art of food.
4,5,2,5,"The servers are knowledgeable, but over attentive, not to say pretentious. They wanted constant affirmation that everything was ok. On the other hand, the server was truly helpful when one of us had to return the soup because it was too spicy. She was happy to replace it with a milder version. Much appreciated. It鈥檚 no way your fault, but there appears to have been an umbrella thief on the premises tonight so we had to walk home in the rain. But we still love Talula鈥檚 and will be back."
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful meal with friendly, attentive staff.  Definitely coming back!"
3,5,4,2,"While the food is excellent, service is good, and the interior decor lovely, I probably will not return. The tables are packed so close together that you can't have a private conversation. And, when I sat down and stood up, I couldn't do so without bumping into someone seated at the next table (and I'm not a large person). It was very noisy, one of those places you leave with a scratchy throat from having to speak loud enough to be heard by the person across the table."
5,5,5,5,The food was delicious. The service was outstanding.
5,5,4,5,"We loved this restaurant! The ambiance was very cool and unique, the food was very delicious and fresh, and the service was great as well. We definitely found a new favorite restaurant."
5,5,5,5,Excellent local foods restaurant with creative dishes and a chill atmosphere. My only wish is that they would also offer local wine.
5,5,5,5,Me and my husband went here on a special date night. It was highly recommended all over the internet and they sure know what they are doing! Best food of my life! The service was wonderful and the mods lighting was incredible. The cheese board was the first for and all in all one of the best restaurants we鈥檝e ever been to!
5,5,5,5,Tatiana was an incredible server! She accommodated my dietary restrictions and remained professional for one of our particularly difficult family members (sorry about that!)
4,4,4,4,Great spot for brunch. We sat at the bar.
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely delicious food, fantastic decor, and wonderful service. One of my favorite restaurants. Additional bonus: the staff brought us a small complementary dessert with a candle (as it was someone's birthday)."
5,5,5,5,"Squash soup was delicious, my sea bass and cous cous was delicious as well, and my significant other thoroughly enjoyed her crab pasta dish.  Service was attentive but not intrusive.  Meals were served pretty quickly for a busy Saturday."
5,5,5,5,Couldn鈥檛 have been any better! Such a wonderful evening from walking in the door through dessert!
5,5,5,5,Dinner was delicious and the service was incredible.  Great wine selection.  A very enjoyable evening
5,5,5,5,"Food was incredibly fresh, with lots of flavor. Wonderful detail to using seasonal vegetables in the dishes. Nice ambiance, and waitress gave us nice amount of time between courses to enjoy everything. Superb job!!"
5,5,5,5,Great! Food was wonderful . Nice attentive service.
1,1,4,1,They arranged us to a narrow table . I hate narrow things !
5,5,5,5,Service was superb.  Busy evening therefore noise level not great and tables near to each other therefore very easy to hear neighbor鈥檚 conversations.  Cheese choices and my scallops superb!!! Definitely will dine there again and recommend to my friends.  Tried to make reservations in past for >4 people and was told no.  Seeing how tables can easily be combined not sure I understand  the rule of no more than 4???)
5,5,5,5,Excellent foodGreat service Beautiful room
5,5,5,5,"Just a terrific meal! Our server was great, and all four of us were totally pleased with our meals!"
5,5,5,5,Everyone and everything was was great. Well done guys! That crab pasta was super nice.
5,5,5,5,"As usual, our experience at the Metro was totally delightful.  Scrumptious, beautifully-prepared food presented artistically, friendly-5-star service, charming ambiance.  THANK YOU!"
5,5,5,5,"The best, as always!"
5,5,5,5,Great as always!
5,5,5,5,The coziest restaurant in the city. Perfect ambiance for a party of 2 or a party of 8. The excellent menu and quality of service always a given.
5,5,5,5,"Love Metro! Great vibe and atmosphere, and the food and service are always top notch."
5,5,5,5,Delicious food and great service.
5,5,5,5,Fabulous seasonal menu! Love this OKC Gem!!!!
5,5,5,5,"The Metro is one of our favorite restaurant.  It is always consistently great-service, food, wine.  We love it.  We generally go there for my hubby's birthday (Halloween) and always have a great meal.  This year was no different.  I am glad we have this great restaurant in our city."
5,5,5,5,The food was excellent. Oliver served us and she was outstanding. Always enjoy the Metro.
5,5,5,5,"Our dinner here in late October 2019 was particularly delicious and the service was extraordinarily good. For two entr茅es, two salads and two drinks the tab came to about $100 plus tip."
5,5,5,5,"I love the cozy ambience of this place; laid back, elegant, and intimate. The food and wine were outstanding.  The service is attentive without being intrusive.  This is head and shoulders the best restaurant in OKC and and is consistently excellent every time.  We will definitely be coming back next time we are in the area."
5,5,5,5,"The Metro  never disappoints me!  The food, service and ambiance are always right on.  Soup and salad on a Sunday night with bread pudding and cr猫me brulee for dessert was outstanding."
5,5,5,5,Our favorite place in all of OKC! A great atmosphere and wonderful food!
4,5,5,5,This restaurant does a fantastic job of offering a predictable high quality of product and service year after year! The menu changes changes with the season... the wonderful service does not change. It's consistently great! We've enjoyed the familiarity of the same wonderful servers for years. That's a part of the ambiance most other restaurants have a difficult time competing with. I generally get the nightly special- Friday might's was braised short ribs over creamy polenta. It was great! Another regular dinner we get is their cedar plank salmon. It's delicious too. The wine by the glass offering is one of the few short comings... they need to be more complete.
5,5,5,5,Best food in town!
5,5,5,5,We always have a fabulous dinner at The Metro!
5,5,5,5,Service and food quality excellence back to back nights while traveling for business.  Highly recommend.
5,5,5,5,The wait staff is so well versed in the menu- thank you for the perfect meal!  My husband and I enjoyed the entire experience from start to finish!
5,5,5,5,The best in OKC.  Period.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful!
5,5,5,5,"Class, Elegance, Outstandingly Delicious!! The current fall menu is wonderful! I love the Strachetti appetizer! The Metro Wine and Bistro is the Best!!!"
5,5,5,5,"Anniversary with my baby. First time there, she enjoyed it."
5,5,5,5,My 70th birthday!
5,5,5,5,A nice birthday lunch!
5,4,4,4,"We love the Metro! We are creatures of habit but occasionally venture out for a special here and there. I had the special Moroccan-spiced lamb chops which were wonderful! The wine, cheese trio and delightful pumpkin cheesecake along with the service were all top-notch as always!"
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, great service. We will be returning very soon!"
5,5,5,5,"Each and every time we have dined here, the food has been perfect and the servers are friendly yet professional. Easily the best restaurant in the city."
5,5,5,5,"Pinot Noir wine flights were excellent.  I am a beginner to wine tasting, and I really enjoy the three glasses to evaluate.  Fun and interesting to try.  BTW, I checked on the Wine Searcher app, and these are not cheap wines. Great value.Service was outstanding for fine dining.  Each course was beautifully presented and tasted delicious.  Stracchetti is reminiscent of a tartare, but it is cooked and very flavorful.  Avocado Cucumber soup is absolutely wonderful.  Romary and Juniper Encrusted NY Strip Steak was delicious and a huge portion of steak.  The sauce (red wine reduction?) is perfectly paired and executed.  If all this wasn't enough, Pumpkin Cheesecake with Cinnamon Whipped Cream and Orange Gastrique - OH WOW!  Paired the steak with a big, bold Rioja.  Perfect meal."
5,5,5,5,"My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary Wednesday night and had a wonderful dinner. The food at The Metro is always superb and this night was no exception. Our server, Oliver, was charming and friendly and had answers to all our questions about food and wine recommendations. She even brought us a sampler dessert as a celebratory treat, so we could each have a bite of something we liked. This place is a neighborhood favorite in a lovely, upscale area, and is our special place for special dinners. Bonus: one of the best curated wine lists anywhere!"
5,5,5,5,"As always, The Metro cam through with a perfect dining experience, from the attentive but not intrusive staff to the superior menu (with tempting and delicious seasonal options, explained beautifully by our server).  It is always a joy to dine at The Metro!"
5,5,5,5,Great as always!
5,5,5,4,"I went there with a few work colleagues. I wanted to go for the angel hair onion rings. I forgot how big the full portion is which we got for the table. My friends agreed they were fabulous. This is not a good place for someone who is vegan, but they were very accommodating adapting the spinach/arugula salad. They offered to add tofu which they saut茅ed in EVOO & lemon which worked very nicely. My friends enjoyed their dishes, but were not able to ear a lot because of being so full from the onion rings. Definitely going back, but only getting a 1/2 portion of the O-rings next time."
2,3,4,4,"Plenty of dimly lit lamps and jazz overhead to give a nice ambiance. My mom and I weren't wowed by our stuffed flounder and veggies. There was nothing special about them. When I spend this much money on dinner, I should be paying for something special."
5,5,5,5,Food excellent and service great !!
5,5,5,5,"Hands down our favorite. It is great for a lunch date with friends, fun night out, and great for family celebrations. They are great and very accommodating. You can not beat the food and service."
5,5,5,5,"Great! As always,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
5,5,5,5,"I've been going to the Metro since they first opened, some 30-years ago.  The consistency of the menu, preparation, atmosphere, service has never wavered from excellence. I do not live in OKC but often plan my travels so I can stop overnight and enjoy a relaxing evening at the Metro."
5,5,5,5,"The Metro continues to set the bar for fine vegetarian dining, this time with a Mexican inspired dish. Vegan option. It tasted much better than it looks in this pic. Pricey, yes. Remember, it鈥檚 fine dining. Vegetarian special changes every few months. Never been disappointed."
5,5,5,5,Great food good service
5,5,5,5,"The Metro is the best!   Wonderful food, wine, service and atmosphere!"
5,5,5,5,"As always, a terrific experience."
4,4,5,2,"Lovely branzino. Good wine, but quite overpriced. The veal was magnificent, though very very expensive."
5,5,5,5,"Arrived early for our reservation, and was greeted warmly. Only waited a couple of minutes before the table was available. The staff were all great, and the atmosphere was fun and comfortable.  The food was delicious!"
5,5,5,4,Efficient and tasty.
5,5,5,5,One of our faves!!!
5,5,5,4,"We went to Tuscano鈥檚 today for lunch. We had great service from the minute we walked in. Our server told us the specials, my husband opted for the seafood pasta which she said was excellent ,I had the orchestra which is small pasta shells with Broccoli, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic. We both enjoyed our pastas& We can鈥檛 wait to go back!"
5,5,5,5,Wonderful as always! 猸愨瓙猸愨瓙猸
5,5,5,5,Everything excellent but noise level too high.  Can't do anything about it but it is distracting
5,5,5,5,Great food and service.
5,5,5,3,"A new wine list includes man regional wines  in the $50 to $100 range, considerably less expensive than the Brunellos and Barolos, that are exciting and satisfying.  The food was excellent.  I always include a small bowl of spaghetti, with butter and Parmesan, not on the menu which arrives just right, not too large a portion and al dents."
5,5,5,5,"This restaurant is always outstanding!  The artichoke salad is next level, pasta are insane & the dishes all feel clean & light."
5,5,5,5,One of the best Italian food in town
5,5,5,4,Love the food! Service was excellent... can't wait to go back!
5,5,5,5,Toscana has been our favorite lunch place for 28 years.
5,5,5,4,loved it. Fabulous food and the wine selection was very nice. Great service!
4,4,4,4,One gets used to the off hand manner of the maitre d if one has been away for a while. We were put at a table smack on the middle of the room. The waiter was charming. Food was good as always.
5,5,5,4,Good food and great service. What else do you want.
5,5,5,5,"As always, OUTSTANDING. Best Italian food in the west coast."
3,3,3,3,"We felt very rushed and unattended to. We were told certain tables by the windows were reserved, when in fact I witnessed a walk-in seated there. They brought out appetizer at the same time as the entree. I had dined here some time ago, but now I see no reason to return again"
5,5,5,5,Awesome food and service.  As always Toscana lives up to expectations.  Highly recommend!
5,5,5,5,"Delicious food, wonderful service, gracious always"
5,5,5,5,Excellent waiter. Great food. Best table! Loved it
5,5,5,4,The best!!
5,5,5,5,Upscale twists on homestyle Italian food. Very friendly and welcoming service
5,5,5,5,Great food and service.
5,5,5,4,"Welcoming, friendly service, perfectly seasoned and prepared food."
5,5,5,5,Great food. Great service. A bit expensive... $$$$
5,5,5,5,Mark was outstanding as usual.  He is the BEST.
5,5,5,5,30 years of excellence.  This was no exception.  Staff and service extraordinary.  Here's to 30 more years of excellence.
3,3,3,3,"Kinda disappointed. I remember coming to this place 4 yrs ago and at that time they served plates with passion. Seems now, that they are resting on their laurels. My risotto did not seem like it was made with arborio rice...it was al dente and then some. Seasoning was ho-hum....I literally could serve up something better with my own version of arborio rice, chicken stock, parmigiano reggiano, dry fino sherry, and diced onions. Not sure what鈥檚 going on there....hopefully things will get back to the way they were"
5,5,5,5,Food was outstanding. Service over the top. Wonderful atmosphere. 5 Stars on all levels. Oh and amazing wine list.
5,5,5,5,Traditional Italian foods served nice and hot.  The vegetable bowls on the table are a nice plus.  Our sever was professional and excellent.
5,4,4,4,Very nice!
5,5,5,5,"always great, high energy. excellent food and wine"
5,5,5,5,First time in LA in 30 years.  First dinner on our first night in town.  HOMERUN!!!  LOVED everything.  Can鈥檛 wait to go back 鉂わ笍
3,3,1,3,"When we walked in, there were mostly empty tables but the host decided to seat us against the wall rather than a pretty window seat. I asked to move and he said if we don鈥檛 stay long! Then the waiter was so rude. He鈥檚 an older, bitter Italian man that should retire. He gave us a few different wines to taste and reminded us that I only get one glass to test them! How rude. He also said he didn鈥檛 feel well and his throat hurt. Then go home! We don鈥檛 want to get sick, either!  He was so unprofessional, and unpleasant all around. Also, the risotto tasted like stale rice and frozen vegetables from the freezer section at Ralph鈥檚. Nerano is much better and I鈥檓 treated like a human there"
5,5,5,5,Always great food. I love the fresh artichoke salad.
5,5,5,4,Excellent food and service. It s expensive but worth it.  Toscana is a special place where I have dined at least 100 times.  Enough said.
5,5,5,5,Best food everything is truly delicious!!  great service...
4,5,3,4,"Food is always excellent.  Service is always the same--mediocre.  I think the servers were trained in NYC!  It's noisy but I expect that there, and it really doesn't bother me."
5,5,5,4,Best duck ever the gnocchi dish was superb also great cocktails at the bar
3,5,3,2,"Same good food, but atmosphere and service are not nearly as good. Perhaps a bad night, but was not the special experience I expect. Scallop and Halibut courses were excellent.  Despite having roasted oysters online menu, they offered only raw...and declined my request for roasted (despite only 5 people in the restaurant).  Space looks empty and not finished. The value pre fixed menu offerings were not offered until I inquired. Hopefully they get it together and return to what was once one of my Philadelphia favorites."
4,4,5,5,Great place and awesome service. The octopus risotto was a bit salty but they exchanged it without any issues. My venisin dish was a bit dry so I would recommend sticking with fish. The escargot was terrific and so was the scallops. Pricy but great
5,5,5,4,The food and drinks were excellent and our server was very pleasant and added to our dining experience. We can't wait to go back.
5,5,5,5,Birthday dinner.. wonderful food and ambiance
5,5,5,5,"Worth the steep price -- very unique flavors and options, even considering the great food options in Philadelphia. The wait staff were friendly, helpful, and attentive. Really an exceptional eating experience. Excited about the move of this wonderful restaurant to our neighborhood."
5,5,4,4,Excellent experience. A great menu that was well executed.
3,4,3,3,Though our waitress was attentive food service was slow. Food was generally good though the risotto was too salty.Desserts were unexceptional.   Printing happy birthday on the menu was a very nice touch
5,5,5,4,"The food was lovely, and the setting is elegant. It got loud as the evening went on, but no more so than is typical for Center City."
4,4,5,2,Not up to the standard of the previous Townsend....location is convenient for the neighborhood folks.
5,5,5,5,Fabulous meal and a lovely atmosphere suitable for a special occasion!
4,4,4,3,It was just okay overall. I ate at the previous location at least 3 times and that was absolutely perfect. I am not impressed with this new spot especially the ambiance. The ambiance and the whole experience does not match the price point. Almost as if it鈥檚 over priced. Hopefully something can be done to improve the look and feel. The food was okay. The previous location was cozy and more intimate. And the price was right for the whole experience. My favorite meal was the steak. I always ordered the steak. Unfortunately that no longer exists on the menu. Maybe it will come back at some point.
5,5,4,3,"The new location is very nice, but most importantly the food remains outstanding.  Only issue is the lack of lighting, making reading the menu almost impossible."
4,5,5,3,Preferred the old bar and parlor. Food and service top notch!
4,4,4,3,It was much too noisy. Something needs to be done to dampen the sound.
5,5,5,4,"Food and wine were very good, so were the friendly and professional serving staff."
3,3,2,4,Very pretentious Server overly aggressiveActed more like a salesperson Halibut was very saltyInedible for one guestMenu limited and not very customer friendly
5,5,5,4,"We have been to the Townsend in South Philly in the past and enjoyed it as 4 to 5 stars. This new Townsend on Walnut is even better!  My wife and I celebrated our 14th anniversary with a marvelous dinner.  We were greeted by menus with ""Happy Anniversary""  on the masthead. Let me say that the Service was impeccable, delightful and very professional - 5 START for BETH G! To start - Cocktails; Manhattan for wife, and ""Catch me if you Can"" for me.  Appetizers - Pork Rillette and Sweet Jesus Oysters; everything awesome! Entr茅e - Venison and Halibut; double AWESOME! Dessert - Pot De Cr猫me for both of us; which was Heaven on Earth. And Then with all of this wonderful food - Glasses of Port on the house!  Wine with dinner was a bottle of Maestro Garnacha Rose - excellent for our choice of food and palette. I do have a suggestion for the space, which my wife and I liked - we sat by the entrance which on a rainy cold night was bothersome as people came in and did not bother to shut the door. A suggestion for bread basket - warm bread before serving.  GO GO GO to this wonderful place!"
3,3,3,3,"Value for dollars spent not there. Limited selection, inconsistently executed."
3,4,3,4,We will go back but would hope they revise their wine selection in the 鈥渂y glass鈥 choices. We were very disappointed with the quality/price but they were gracious to exchange. The starters were good but not great. Our main courses excellent. The service we felt needed a boost in sophistication. This place has a lot of potential and we wish them luck.
5,5,5,5,"Menu options were varied, and all lovely choices. I wished they had a wine pairing for their courses."
5,5,5,5,"We enjoyed the simple but elegant dining room.  Mary our server was attentive but not hovering.  She allowed us to savor and enjoy our meal but appeared when wine or water needed refilling.We ate three courses each.  The escargots were earthy and tasty.  I would get it again.  The Artic Char was refreshing and a great beginning to a meal.  Also would be on my repeat menu.On second course we had the sea scallops and the potato gnocchi.  The sea scallops had so much flavor.  They were some of the best scallops I鈥檝e ever had.  The gnocchi was delicious as well.On the last course we had the venison and duck.  The venison was peppery and delicious.  The duck was also well prepared and tasty.  My only negative comment on the last course was that it was larger than I am accustomed at a French restaurant and therefore I was unable to savor every bite.The wine list was a great addition to the meal.  We started with a Chardonnay and switched to a Cabernet Sauvignon with our more hearty last course.  It was a perfect combination.This restaurant should definitely be on your must try list.  When back in Philadelphia, we will return."
5,4,4,3,Preferred the old location
5,5,5,4,"Amazing food, beautiful ""cool"" space, great service."
4,4,3,3,I know they have newly opened in this space but Townsend has been around and we found not having a salad choice or a filet on the menu put us in uncomfortable decisions as one of us was dieting and the other only eats meat. What I did have was good but the waitress was all over the place and slow taking our order. I asked for no bread and we were served it. We used to enjoy going to the old place this not so much.
4,5,5,4,"We were disappointed the bar didn't stock Jack Daniels or Grey Goose. Food was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. Our server, David, was gracious and informative about ingredients and preparation of the dishes. I was looking forward to some sort of flakey sweet for dessert but the three choices offered didn't fulfill my wish so I had a glass of port instead. We let them know it was our 50th wedding anniversary that day. It would've been a nice touch if they had given us a complimentary after dinner drink."
5,5,5,5,"Charming space. Food was creative and delicious. My husband had oysters as a starter which he usually likes plain, but the various additions really worked without overwhelming the delicacy of the oysters. My starter was beautifully prepared and presented marinated Arctic char."
4,5,5,4,Food was great. Love a good table cloth restaurant. They haven鈥檛 figured out the decor yet- would be great to have some Philly art on the walls!  Would be a great location for a jazz or cabaret brunch!
2,2,2,2,Off night at Townsend. Unfortunately. Really hope they are able to get it back together. Disappointed.
5,5,5,5,"The perfect dinner for our anniversary! Every course was outstandingly delicious, the service from Megan was so great, she鈥檚 very personable and knowledgeable and made our experience a top-notch one! Delicious drinks & desserts too but I have to say that the curry vermouth cream w the crispy branzino was my favorite, probably the most delicious thing I鈥檝e ever tasted! Beautiful restaurant, great new Rittenhouse location! We loved every minute and will definitely be coming back!"
5,5,5,4,Limited menu but the food is superb. The food takes a while but worth patience.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful place! New location is modern and more spacious...maybe a little less character. Food was excellent as expected!
4,4,4,3,Limited menu
4,3,4,4,"I enjoyed my experience recently at Townsend but my only issue was that I thought my entree, the halibut with clams and baby octopi was a bit too salty."
4,5,4,1,"The food and service were very good, but the space was sterile which was a little disappointing. The ambiance in the passyunk square location was much better."
5,5,5,5,"It's a spacious and very beautiful room. There's a good cocktail list, and the one I had was delicious. The server - I think her name was Amy - was first-class and fun, and the food was consistently superb. Good competition for Vernick just along the street.Bernard"
5,5,5,5,Best service ever! 10/10 would recommend
4,4,4,3,"Liked the ambiance, active but not deafening on a Friday night. Meal main (fish bourrade) was delicious, poached pear dessert served with a fiery pepper cream was too savory, not sweet enough for a satisfying dessert."
3,4,4,4,I ordered the three courses. We waiting about an hour between the first and second course.
3,4,3,2,"I've been a fan of Townsend and Tod's other restaurant for years.  We were excited to try this expanded re-boot of his original restaurant.  Sadly, we were somewhat disappointed.  First, they took one of the coolest, sexiest restaurant spaces in Philly and neutered it.  They turned it into a bland, cold, white box.  Instead of just cutting back the too-long bar, they relocated it to the back where bar patrons have to sit with their backs to the room...a very uncomfortable feeling.  finally, while the food remains quite good, it doesn't feel updated or renewed.  Lastly, the service was friendly but strange.  We had to ask for bread, after watching tables around us being given bread immediately.  Bread was served without butter, which we had to ask for three times.  I'm hoping what we experienced was opening jitters.  Not sure what they can do to warm-up the room?"
5,5,5,5,Best table on the House.
5,5,5,5,"Louis was our server. He was professional, polite and helped us make great food selections. I had a wonderful time celebrating my boyfriend鈥檚 birthday. :)"
5,5,4,4,"Delicious healthy food, with fantastic cocktails"
5,5,5,5,Great place for healthier food options.  Friendly staff.
5,5,5,5,I have a lot of food allergies and they were so accommodating and kind. It made the whole meal and experience even better. Love eating at this place!!
5,5,5,5,Sweet potatoes drowning in sauce
5,5,5,5,Phil was such an amazing waiter! He made our night
3,3,1,1,We went there for dinner. It was very loud. Some dishes were too salty. But the edamame dumplings and the pizza with sweet potato were very good. Service was ok.
4,5,3,3,"I first tried True Food in Los Angeles and really enjoyed the experience.  The food is made fresh; very healthy options and nice portion sizes.  They also good vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free options that don't sacrifice flavor or portion size.  Although not vegan, the Chicken Sausage Lasanga is one of the best dishes on their menu.  I also enjoy the Avacado Toast during brunch.  Both dinner and brunch here are good!"
5,5,5,5,"Casual ambiance with high food integrity standards.  Fresh ingredients with more than the usual number of vegan options.  Great service, full bar, moderate noise and most importantly amazing food.  Beet flatbread to start, grain bowls, sea bass - all good choices.  A place to visit often."
5,5,5,5,AMAZING thank you
4,4,4,4,"One of the best things about True Food Kitchen is similar to other chains.  You know what you're going to get regardless of where you are. The food is predictably good but not wonderful, the service is good, the wine list is not extensive but interesting.  In a major city like Chicago there are other, more creative, better choices, but if you want a dependably good meal, you can't go wrong with True Food Kitchen.  It's also an excellent place to go with people with a variety of diets.  We tend to eat vegan/vegetarian, and there are nice options.  If members of your party are major carnivores, they too will find options.  Likewise with gluten free, lactose intolerant, etc.  Since we have family and friends in the Chicago area who are all of the above, True Food Kitchen is an obvious choice and everyone has a good meal."
5,5,5,5,Pre-theatre dining
5,5,5,5,"The vegan food was all great. I wish I could try more menu items! I would say though, that the portions are small, especially for the price. But, this leaves room for desert. Best dairy-free ice cream I have ever had! We liked what we had so much that we ordered the Unbeetable burger togo!"
3,2,4,4,"Overall, ambiance and service was great. My only constructive feedback would be that the food was a little bland. I ordered the coconut fish dish, and felt like dish did not have enough acidity or spices. Consider using stronger flavours."
5,5,5,5,The food was great. I had the TLT burger and the tempeh was delicious. My bf had a quinoa burger which he also loved. Overall great experience. The service was also great.
5,5,5,5,"The food was so fresh and amazing, so v/gf/allergy friendly! The waitstaff was lovely and the atmosphere is elevated but not stuffy. Highly recommend!"
4,5,2,4,Food was great as usual. Service was a bit inattentive but overshadowed by how yummy the food was!
4,4,4,3,Excellent salad. So-so pizza. Good poke- bowl. Out of all specialty beers at 6:30 on a Friday???
3,4,4,1,"The food is very good. Not excellent but very good. However, the noise level is so loud as to be uncomfortable. I will take out food from there but don't plan to eat in the restaurant."
3,3,3,3,We would go back. Our friends really liked one of the deserts.  I enjoyed the curry. The food came a little too fast
5,5,5,5,Service was great. Food phenomenal. Highly recommend. Decor is cool Af
5,5,5,5,Did not disappoint. A favorite go to for a girls night out quickie.
5,5,5,5,Fresh quality ingredients in well put together dishes.
3,3,4,4,Supposed to be quality food but tastes like vegetables taken out of the freezer.
5,5,5,5,Excellent scratch kitchen! Loved the entire menu! The butternut squash soup was one of the best I have ever had. The bowl was delicious!
4,4,4,2,"Air conditioning too fierce, it was very cold. Presentation of the crudit茅s was fabulous."
5,5,5,5,"I have been to True Food Kitchen numerous times and have never been disappointed. The food is exceptional. The service is exceptional. The last time I was there, I was dining with 2 old friends. One was going to be very late so we started without her.  Although it was very busy, the staff never rushed us or treated us with impatience. We had a lovely time.  The manager even stopped by to see how we were doing.  True Food is always high on my list when deciding where to go."
5,5,5,5,"True Food was fantastic! Everything was very fresh, light, and made to our liking. Our service was outstanding, which only enhanced our experience. We will definitely be back."
4,4,4,4,"Very good butternut squash soup, edamame dumplings, and we shared the Chicken Fennel Pizza."
3,5,5,4,Fantastic lunch - we thoroughly enjoyed the ancient grains bowl. Bravo!
5,5,5,5,True Food Kitchen was phenomenal! I arrived early for my 12:30 reservation. The place was crowded but there were some tables available as it鈥檚 a very large place. They seemed willing to seat me but I opted to have a hot tea at the bar. The bar service was excellent and the adaptogenic tea was delicious. My party of two was seated in a back table with a friendly server and a little less noise. I ordered the seasonal salad which was out of this world. Very fresh ingredients and amazing flavor combinations. I will dream of this salad for a long time! Can鈥檛 wait to return when I鈥檓 back in Chicago!
5,5,5,5,Great food and amazing atmosphere!
5,5,5,5,Fresh delicious food.  Choice range was fantastic - from Vegan options to steak options.  Super service.  Modern friendly environment.
5,5,4,5,"Absolutely fantastic. There is something (and great food) for everyone, whether you are plant based, GF, want a grass fed burger or a snack, it鈥檚 all there. This place proves finally that healthy, vegan, GF (with added fish and meat options) don鈥檛 need to be an almost take out/office lunch informal menu place, and instead can be beautiful , cozy, modern and refined enough for a nice dinner with candles. Wish we had them in NYC...:("
5,5,5,5,Great happy hour!!
5,5,5,5,Always a great meal and exceptional service. Favorites are ancient grains bowl and chicken wrap!
4,4,3,3,"Good food. Especially liked the chopped salad with its large number of diverse ingredients and champagne vinaigrette. Sea bass also good and, like the chopped salad, accompanied by a wade variety of goodies-farro, baby boy choy, citrus-ed mushrooms, etc. The waiter did his job efficiently and competently, but not very enthusiastically. He didn鈥檛 make much of an attempt at smiling or repartee. Loud! That was the hardest part. Couldn鈥檛 have a comfortable conversation. And the bass in the background music at times felt like it was penetrating my skull. Painful."
5,5,5,5,Healthy food should taste good and True Food makes that happen.
4,4,4,4,"everything we ordered we liked, would def return, if i lived near by i would eat here frequently....they claim they cook healthy and use healthy ingredients and post the calories for everything....all restaurants should be this way.............."
5,4,5,5,The experience and service was great for a date night. Flavours of the vegetarian food was good but was a single tone and could use more variety in taste
5,5,5,5,Wonderful as usual! We鈥檝e been several times over the last couple of years and are always beyond pleased and anxious for our next visit!
5,5,5,4,Most amazing sushi we have ever had.  Very fresh and amazing combinations and ingredients.  We always get the omakase because we can never make up our mind.  Everything is delicious!
5,5,5,5,"As always, Uchi is spectacular!  We usually let the chef鈥檚 surprise us, and it鈥檚 always perfect.  Who needs a menu?  They ask a few questions, then just bring it out a dish at a time!  They will pair with wine or sake if you ask.  Just splendid experience all around."
5,5,5,5,"The food was excellent.  We actually didn't order, the server just asked us a few questions about our preferences and sent plates of food to the table until we told him we were full.  Every single plate was excellent.  I will definitely go back."
5,5,5,5,"Bronson did an amazing job with our Tasting Menu experience. Let your wait staff do the work, enjoy your meal!"
5,5,5,5,Best sushi I ever had complimented by amazing service.  Server chose our entire meal.
5,5,5,5,Great food and service.
5,5,5,5,One of the best all-round meals we have ever had!
5,5,5,5,Always incredible!  Best dining experience all around!
5,5,4,4,Food was excellent. Service was great but fizzled towards the end. Expensive but worth it. I would go back.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, amazing service.  We all had the omakase, and every course was unforgettable.  Perfect balance of hot and cold, served at exactly the right pace, and finished with a perfect sweet treat.  We expected excellence and our expectations were surpassed."
5,5,5,5,Great food and service. One of my favorite restaurants in Dallas.
1,1,3,3,"I ordered Omakas for 2 for $118.00. We were very disappointed. We had 10 courses and 4 were not even sushi, it was salad items and fried squash. I had Omakase there 2-3 years ago and it was fabulous and I expected that again and it was not even close to as delicious or similar items (sushi, like we came for)."
5,5,5,4,"This place is what they say, fantastic experience! Great vibe, food and service!"
4,5,2,5,"Outstanding food!! Service was terrible, our orders were constantly forgotten, our server didn鈥檛 come for 18 minutes once seated. Food was really great extremely expensive but the bad service ruined the meal. It was a $300 dinner and with service that bad is unacceptable."
5,5,5,5,"Birthday dinner. Our waiter was amazing. Food was amazing. They gave us a booth as requested. Relaxing, laid back atmosphere."
5,5,5,5,Thanks bra
5,5,5,5,Taylor was an absolute pleasure - we did the server tasting and she did an amazing job! So so good. Fried milk and foie gras nigiri are not to be missed.
5,5,5,5,Always amazing
5,5,5,5,"It鈥檚 an absolute amazing journey of one decides to be surprised by the chefs choice menu ... a succession of taste, food structures and great combinations.I am very new in Dallas (2months) and I am a big foodie. I already visited a dozen of high reputation restaurants, but none of them comes close. Uchi is way above all the rest ! Next to the incredible food, the service is amazing. It really a serial of wow moments throughout the evening.If you haven鈥檛 been here, this must be your next stop!"
5,5,5,5,Excellent!
5,5,5,5,Love uchi!
1,4,1,3,Terrible experience w staff and those who sat us at the bar and then left us to fend for ourselves when we had another group of all guys take it over. Was terrible more like a McDonald鈥檚 for service. Expect to pay a premium for substandard service
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding as always. My go-to spot after work, and these guys always knock it out of the park. People reading this - don鈥檛 be too shy to try table service, leave the bar for us lonely folks! Haha Just kidding :)"
5,5,5,5,Best service in town! Everyone working there is happy very cordial and very educated on sushi and obviously Uchi!
5,5,5,5,Quite possibly the best food we鈥檝e ever eaten.  Great portions and not over priced.
5,5,5,5,"Quan was INCREDIBLE. We chose to order the server鈥檚 choice and he exceeded our expectations. Portions were perfect, wine selection was impeccable, and the service was top notch. I loved every minute dining at Uchi. Chef and his team outdid themselves. I hope to be back as soon as possible. My date and I left and we both were blown away by this experience. Hands down the BEST meal I have ever had."
4,5,3,5,"Omakase was outstanding as usual, with a good mix of dishes. Only issue was that our service wasn't super attentive, which honestly was surprising since we sat at the sushi bar. We would be looking around for our server, and see her talking to another couple at the end of the bar for 15+ minutes. I understand it's great to get that personal attention but there are other customers too. Our sushi chef was not very involved at all in our experience, and the courses were rushed, as if he was just trying to get them out to us so he could continue talking with his friends who were sitting nearby. However, I understand this is definitely not the norm for Uchi, and we would of course come back because the food is the best in town, and the service is usually exemplary."
5,5,5,5,"All of the sushi (yellowtail mainly) we had, as well as salads, veggies, and ""sushi Rolls"" were phenomenal! 5 * good- then, the sake- really great and not too pricey -  then dessert, Viet coffee dessert was over the top. Our daughter ans son-in-law got the ""Chefs Special at about $ 40 per person and were equally pleased- we have already agreed to put this one into out normal Restaurant rotation-give it a try!!!"
5,5,5,5,Both food and staff are excellent. Very well run place.
3,5,2,2,The food is spectacular! Service was a little off - server was obviously new but definitely kind! Ambiance not quite as fun as uchiko in Austin but just as yummy
5,5,5,5,"Normally get James, but he wasn鈥檛 available so was given Stephanie. She did an amazing job, was very pleased with the service. Noise level was slightly high, but as expected. Valet service was excellent as well."
5,5,5,5,A night with our adult sons. Great way to dine and enjoy the variety of dishes!
5,5,5,5,"Best dinner I had on my trip to Dallas, hands down. Before my date and I were even seated, we were greeted by the host with an amuse bouche. At the bar, we immediately received a hot towel for our hands and a palate cleanser. Our server Linh was friendly and warm. We went with every recommendation that Chef Ian has for us that evening, giving him our complete trust, and he didn鈥檛 steer us wrong. Every bite was delicious. Although we were full, Chef Ian told us we had to try their famous 鈥淔ried Milk鈥 dessert, and W O W. I鈥檒l be definitely be back next time I鈥檓 in town."
5,5,5,5,Food was perfect .  Good for special occasions.
5,5,5,5,Awesome as always.    Let the waiter order!!
5,5,5,5,"This was our first time at Uchi, and it was epic!  Our server Branson took amazing care of us.  He was very knowledgable and made wonderful suggestions based on our parameters.  Truly a night to remember!"
5,5,5,5,Every single bite was fantastic on the omakase and our server Travis put together a wonderful alcohol pairing to go with our meal. The foie gras sushi was amazing. The desserts were great as well.
5,5,5,5,Winnie is the best! Always!!
5,5,5,5,Our server was excellent. We were celebrating a birthday and he ensured we got the special dessert that was limited in quantity. The birthday girl was pleased.
5,5,4,2,It was way more hip than I remembered. The music was super loud. But the fish was delicious!!!
5,5,5,5,Just perfect.  Food from start to finish was outstanding and we loved it all.
5,5,5,5,Always  a great time!! Most professional staff in Atlanta!!! If I lived closer I would be here 3 times a week!!馃槝 Michelle is the most cheerful server in Atlanta
5,5,4,5,The food and atmosphere were great. Our server had some fantastic recommendations and I feel like we got the full effect. Very pricey for sushi.
5,5,5,5,Anniversary
4,5,5,4,"Food and service were outstanding, tables are very close together...highly recommended"
5,5,5,5,Our server Michelle was awesome!  One of our favorite places.
5,5,5,5,Pretty much never changes........  always awesome
4,5,4,4,Espectacular dinner experience that offers great combination of tastes and high quality ingredientes. I had a unique romantic dinner date with my couple. Will be a must go every time I visit ATL
3,3,3,4,"Food was fine, not worth what we got. I suspect the rolls were not the right thing to get, but should not have been so lackluster. When we checked in they couldn't find our reso - then when they did did not apologize - and we got no acknowledgement of our anniversary and were seated at a communal table. All in all, pretty disappointing considering our expectations."
5,5,5,5,Food and service was amazing as always. Seating is awfully cramped though....only downside.
5,5,4,5,Food was fantastic.
3,3,3,1,"So loud in the restaurant that we couldn't hear each other.  That really taints the experience.  The food is very expensive, but feels like you're in a bar."
5,5,5,5,"Took my aunt here for her birthday, she came down from California. The food was great, she loved it."
4,5,5,5,"so effn good, from the drinks to the menu to the food and the dessert...yummy"
5,5,5,5,The best Asian culinary experience i have ever had. Exceptional.
5,5,5,5,Husband鈥檚 birthday!
5,5,5,5,Food was delicious.Dress code requirements werent as enforced as described.Wait staff was excellent.
5,5,5,5,Our favorite sushi with amazing service
5,5,5,5,Umi is my favorite restaraunt!!! They have the best run establishment in Atlanta. Best sushi ever!!!
5,5,5,5,Great restaurant and food. But nothing special for my wife except a verbal 鈥淗appy Birthday鈥 on a very special birthday. That was disappointing.
5,5,5,5,This was our second visit to Umi and I must say it was completely amazing!  The food was incredible and the service was over the top.  There is no other place we will go for amazing Sushi in Atlanta!  We will be back soon!  Thank you for another great evening!
3,5,5,1,I love the food but the noise level is way too high. The banquette tables are too close together. So close that the servers can鈥檛 help but to bump into you almost every time they come to the adjacent tables. Just a little extra space would make such a difference and make it easier not to have a loud adjacent table not ruin your dinner. Also the lighting is so dark that many tables have to use their phone  flashlights to read the menus which also distracts adjacent diners. Again we absolutely love the food but the above issues make us think twice about going every time.
4,5,5,4,"Some of the highest quality sushi and Japanese cuisine in the city, outstanding service, and a chic-but-cramped dining environment. Even considering the quality of the cuisine and the overall experience, there is no getting around that the prices are high. Great for a small party (<4) celebrating a special occasion. Would definitely return!"
5,5,5,5,Michelle is the best server on the planet
5,5,5,5,Celebrating friends and birthdays.
4,4,4,4,Great experience!
5,5,5,5,"We had a great time, the food was amazing. If you like Japanese cuisine, I don't think I've had better. (And if you like spicy, I definitely recommend the kamikaze roll) It was busy so the noise was the regular din of people talking, but we were still able to hear each other across our table. We would certainly go again."
5,5,5,5,Yet another incredible experience. New menu is outstanding!!
5,5,5,5,"Great ambience, superb service by Dickson and always tasty and high quality food.  Looking forward to coming back next week"
5,5,5,5,Amazing food as always
5,5,4,3,Visitor in town
5,5,5,5,Dixon remembers us-knows what we like and most of all the food is uniquely delicious!
5,5,5,5,As always just the best restaurant in Atlanta
4,4,4,3,"Great cocktails and wine. Loved the rock shrimp, soft shell crab roll and lobster roll. We were disappointed with the miso black cod."
5,5,5,5,Top Restaurant. It was my 2nd time at UMI and it was great again. Wish there were in Germany too!
5,4,5,5,Best sushi in Atlanta! Don鈥檛 order off menu - just ask them to bring you whatever the chef recommends! You won鈥檛 be disappointed!
5,5,5,5,Paul was a great waiter ! Really enjoyed our anniversary dinner
3,4,3,4,I enjoyed the sushi and found it of a very high quality. What disappointed us was how rushed we felt. It was apparent that getting people in and out rapidly was more important than letting diners enjoy and take their time and I found that very unpleasant. I would not return but this is just me. The food is good and I think anyone loving sushi will enjoy it.
5,5,4,5,"Excellent food. We had a slight issue with the service - the salmon needed to be cooked through more, and the served acted like we were asking her to summit Mt. Everest - but it got fixed in the end. A good place for a business lunch (which is why we were there)."
3,3,4,4,"We were there for Sunday Brunch to celebrate my daughters birthday. Upland had great ambiance and good service but all 4 meals (pasta, quiche, eggs) came out room temperature. Flavors were great but no excuse for food not coming to the table hot at this restaurant."
4,4,5,5,The couple next to us was extremely annoying and ruined the experience basically. It would have been just okay otherwise. I probably would not return. It was nothing special.
5,4,5,4,Everything was wonderful except the shrimp and rice dish. It seemed to consist mostly of shrimp shells (creepy) and not much shrimp meat at all.
5,4,4,5,I visit New York around 4-6 times a year.  I am always looking for new places to eat and saw Uplands on a list of brunch spots to try.  This was my first visit to Uplands.  It was in a great location and the restaurant itself is spacious and beautiful - not typical for many restaurants in the city.  Food was very good - we went with the server's recommendations and were not disappointed.  My husband had the fried chicken sandwich and I had the Egg and Tortilla.  I asked for scrambled eggs instead of fried egg and it was no problem.  We had mimosas and Bloody Marys and then finished with the Donuts. We wouldn't normally do that but the donuts were recommended.  Enjoyed the experience from start to finish - we will definitely be back.
5,5,5,5,Loved everything about it. Food service and decor were all absolutely perfect.
5,4,5,5,I went early with a friend.  We ordered a few appetizers and some wine.  Nice sized portions and very fresh food.  Excellent service.  Will definitely come back
3,5,1,5,"I have been coming to Upland since it first opened and it has been a consistently good experience in terms of both food and service.  Unfortunately on my last visit our server was SO RUDE and put us on edge for the entire dinner because we were nervous of being barked at!  She tried to take our appetisers away when we were half way though and when we said we weren鈥檛 finished yet, she decided she would change our plates for some unknown reason...then a minute later our mains arrived so we ended up not actually being able to enjoy the rest of our appetisers!  It was quite embarrassing because I had a guest in from out of town and got them to cancel their reservation at L鈥橝rtusi to come to Upland instead!  I really hope it was a one off be side I really do enjoy Upland, but next time I will think twice before returning since New York is full of great restaurants with great service."
2,2,2,1,Expensive. Noisy.  Pizza was burnt.  My friend asked for a slight modification in her meal (a vegetable instead of the rice) and the waiter didn't even try to accommodate.  Highly overrated.
3,3,2,4,The service was truly terribly. Our server was very stuck up and almost acted like it was a burden to serve us. The food was also overly salty. My favourite thing was the caesar salad.
4,4,3,3,"Our server was grumpy and I was surprised because I have usually had really lovely service.   It kind of bummed me out.  I loved our meal despite him but it bothered me a lot, I have been in food service and I know when someone is over it, it shows.   Otherwise Jennifer made it right by coming over to check on us!"
5,5,5,5,"We agreed that this is our favorite NYC restaurant, hands-down.  Impeccable food and service, both enjoyed in a beautiful and quiet room. We will keep returning."
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful brunch, great drinks and very professional staff."
5,5,5,5,"We went to Upland for a celebratory engagement dinner with both sets of parents.  This place is incredible.  Every dish is well thought out and you don't need to spend an arm & a leg for a truly great meal like other places in NYC.  Highly recommend the hen of the wood, tomato soup & caesar salad"
5,5,5,5,Such a fantastic meal with fantastic service!!
5,5,5,4,Great vibe and great food. Loved that you could have a conversation
3,3,3,4,This is usually a fave but was quite disappointing.  Our waitress tried to rush us and my main dish (salmon) had strange sides.
4,4,5,4,"Pizzas and salads are great.  I had the feta spinach omelet, but it did not have much feta or spinach in it.  The slice of bread given the side was truly hard as a rock, so could not break or bite.  Otherwise it is a great place.  Service, ambiance and staff are great.  Will skip the omlette next time."
5,5,5,5,"I love this restaurant. The atmosphere is clean and crisp and appeases anyone's taste/style. The wait staff was incredibly kind and my server was specifically awesome. I took two friends and I would highly suggest this as a restaurant to take someone who is in town for the weekend. We shared an order of donuts at the beginning and the jelly donut was the best I have ever had - huge shout-out to the pastry chef :) All three of our meals were pretty stellar - my one and only hesitation is that it can get quite costly but with that being said, the portions are quite large and we all three had food to-go for later. Thank you!!!"
5,5,5,5,Such a treat. The food is inventive and great. And a fun vibe.
5,5,5,5,Food and service were great. Two outstanding pastas. Beautiful space with a great vibe. Great meal always consistent
3,5,5,5,Would never go back because of noise level tho good excellent
5,5,5,4,The food is unique and delicious... the cocktail drink menu was very good!
5,5,5,5,There's a reason Upland is always one of my favorite restaurants in the city - they always deliver great food and experience
5,4,5,5,"We had a great evening here. Great food and service , and a really lively buzzy ambience. All you want from a restaurant !"
4,4,4,4,Great food! Great location! Energetic noise level!
5,5,5,5,We went for a casual meal. The service was great. I spilt my espresso martini and they made me a new one straight away
5,5,5,5,Great dining experience! Will visit again!
4,5,4,4,Great food! Love the decor!
1,1,4,3,Staff was great but the burger was terrible.
5,5,4,5,"This was my second time here and both times, I really enjoyed it. I came for my birthday brunch and we were a party of 4. The first table we were seated at wasn't great, but they let us have a booth and it was much better. The hostesses were very kind and accommodating. Service was good - I always had water in my glass. The atmosphere is so lovely and comfortable! The food was excellent. The sausage and kale pizza is phenomenal. Usually I don't like thicker pizzas but this one managed to be thick without being too heavy or soggy. The crust was crispy and the flavor was out of this world. We also enjoyed the burger very much. The fried chicken sandwich was a bit on the small side but very tasty. Overall, great experience and would go back."
5,5,5,5,Enjoyed brunch at Upland this last weekend! Food and service was fantastic!
5,5,5,5,Always the best!
5,5,5,5,"We had a great dinner --our usual favorites: the 'nduja pizza, the skirt steak, the little gem salad ... all fantastic.  Also an amazing wine list. Fabulous."
5,5,4,4,A very pleased dining  experience with imaginative food offered in an attractive ambiance.
5,5,4,5,Loved the decor. Food was great. One of the best!
2,3,3,1,"Surprisingly  noisy even when we arrived 5:45 pm and deafening by 7:30 pm. My husband and I split a margherita pizza, which was good. The mushroom appetizer/side dish was cooked so most of it was a crisp and had lost most of its flavor and juiciness."
5,5,5,5,Came here for my brothers birthday. The food was amazing and the waitstaff was super attentive. They even came out with a candle on a scoop of ice cream to end the experience! Thank you for a wonderful dinning experience Upland! A wonderful birthday dinner!
2,2,2,3,Both of us unfortunately ordered the smoked monkfish. The vinegar ( which was unexpected) totally overpowered the dish thus ruining the fish.
5,5,5,5,The food and service were wonderful. We will return.
5,0,0,0,"I love this place, if it weren't so difficult to get a reservation, I'd go more often."
4,0,0,0,Food is amazing - difficult to get a reservation or seat at the bar.
5,0,0,0,"One of the few restaurants that actually gets better with age.  Each service person, from the water boy to the manager, glides around attentively to serve patrons.  The wine list is small but select.  pours are very large.  I loved my duck breast, which is always served medium rare (perfect).  Staff is very attentive, with one staff dedicated to just polishing wine glasses.  All details combine to make this a 5 star restaurant.  Others agree, which is why at 5:15 pm on Thursday it was jammed with couples."
4,0,0,0,"Great local spot, excellent cocktails, vibrant energy and location."
5,5,5,5,This was my second visit here and everything was great! I am adding to my list of favorite Philly restaurants. My favorite thing I ordered was the crispy artichokes.  Delicious!
5,5,5,5,25th anniversary I the food was delicious
5,5,5,5,"Vernick never disappoints!  Everything from the appetizers, to entrees, to wine was outstanding.  One my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia!"
5,5,5,5,"As always, dining at Vernick is a wonderful experience. Very good food, drinks and pleasant ambiance. Looking forward to returning for another dinner"
5,5,5,5,Loved sitting at the Chefs counter. Awesome experience!
5,5,5,5,Everything was delicious! The foie gras was probably our favorite of all the small plates we got. The menu was excellent it was hard to make choices because we wanted everything! The cocktails were really good too; strong and refreshing. Can鈥檛 wait to go back!
5,4,5,5,"Vernick was incredible. Service was outstanding! We had a variety of dishes and were not disappointed by any of them, and some were down right amazing. Definitely worth the wait for a reservation."
3,3,4,4,Anniversary
5,5,5,4,"Outstanding original menu creations each with their own x-factor. The white truffle tagliatelle special is indeed very special.  Well thought out wine selections by glass or bottle compliment the plates.  Servus is first rate - attentive, comprehensive, but not overbearing."
5,5,5,5,Everything was incredible food and service Can鈥檛 wait to go back
5,5,5,4,"fantastic service, food, and drinks."
2,2,2,2,Was just okay. Don鈥檛 get all the hype.
5,5,5,5,Amazing experience. Well worth the wait!  Outstanding execution. Terrific service.
5,5,5,5,One of the best Restaurants in Philadelphia and absolutely wonderful fare.
5,5,5,5,Britten was exceptional again.. everything was spectacular top to bottom
5,5,5,5,We just locked the food. If you have mobility issues ask to sit downstairs
4,4,5,5,"The pumpkin toast, roasted cabbage, and curry shrimp were spectacular. The ravioli was good but it was weird that it was just one giant one, also for the price it wasn鈥檛 much. The mushroom toast was good but I think it would have been more enjoyable if it was warm and not served cold. My friend enjoyed the oysters. The service was great! I went to dinner with a friend I haven鈥檛 seen in a year and is in town for Thanksgiving and it was nice that they recommended that we take our time ordering and that there would be 15-20 min between each plate, so we could really enjoy our chatting over the sparkling wine (which I never heard about until dinner tonight!). Definitely will return to Vernick with my husband as I think he鈥檇 enjoy it."
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding restaurant from the moment we walked in until we left. The staff was exceptional, our server was on point, and the food was even better than I could have hoped for: inventive, exciting, and most importantly, delicious! Well done!"
5,5,5,5,"This is the best restaurant in Philly. The most creative and fresh ideas i've seen. I'm a vegetarian, and there are many options!"
5,5,5,5,Anniversary
5,4,5,5,"Service was amazing. Food was delicious although I felt a few of the dishes were on the salty side (the mushroom soup amuse bouche, sea urchin with scrambled eggs, gratin that came with the sea bass)"
5,5,5,5,"Dinner was excellent, as always!"
5,5,5,5,Loved everything!!! Omg the best!!Can鈥檛 wait to go back.
5,5,5,4,One of our favorite restaurants anywhere! We dine here whenever we come to Philadelphia (we live in NYC) and have even talked about hopping on the train just to dine here!
4,4,5,5,The food was very good admittedly a bit pricey for what it was. I did find the food was extremely rich.
5,5,5,5,"Gorgeous menu, beautiful presentation, great wait staff, noisy but worth it!  We鈥檒l go again!"
5,5,5,5,Fantastic service and incredible food. I can鈥檛 wait to go back!
5,5,5,5,"Unbelievable experience, food was exceptional and service was too. I've been trying to get in here on previous trips to Philly and it did not disappoint. One of the better meal experiences ive had in awhile"
5,5,5,5,This is an AMAZING restaurant.  If you consider yourself a foodie then you MUST go here.  Everything we ordered and everything that was complementary was absolutely delicious and wonderful.  I wanted to keep eating and ordering dish after dish.  I went to philly for a few days and was doing research to find the best place to dine and Vernick is the place!  I live in NJ and eat in NYC all the time and I would definitely go back to Philly just to eat at Vernick (I revisited yesterday and it was delicious). I ate at the chef counter a second time and would recommend eating there just to see the chefs work like a well oiled machine with everyone moving with precision and dedicated passion.I went a second time and this place is AMAZING.  The chefs are rock stars and had another amazing enjoyable dinner.
5,5,5,5,"Awesome all around experience! My wife and I are huge foodies and haven鈥檛 been so satisfied since dining at California Grill, Victoria and Alberts, and Flying Fish. Everything was spot on and perfect. Thank you for a wonderful experience."
5,4,5,4,First time visit - enjoyed ourselves very much. Highly recommend.
5,4,5,5,Excellent service and wonderful tastes! Entrees lacked the luster that I had hoped to continue after our toasts and small plates.
5,5,4,5,"One would be hard pressed to find a more delicious meal, it was superb! There is always room for improvement so if I could improve anything... well... the service could be a tad warmer."
5,5,5,4,Been here many times amd have never been disappointed.   Looking forward to our next visit.
5,5,5,5,"Everything was fantastic. The service,the food and the atmosphere.A true  5 star experience"
5,5,5,5,Vernick is always one of the best in town. If you haven鈥檛 been there you need to get there and experience everything they have to offer. One of the treats is sitting at the chefs counter and having your dinner while watching the chefs prepare everyone鈥檚 food. They even have one person who soul responsibility is to make sure your plate is clean and food presented properly before it gets delivered to the table. Top-notch restaurant gets my vote for five stars
5,5,5,5,"Everything about this experience exceeded our expectations.  From wine pairings to every perfect bite, to the spectacular service, I cannot recommend Vetri Cucina strongly enough."
5,5,5,5,"Dinner at Vetri is well beyond fine dining.  This is a culinary experience with careful attention to every detail.  The service team genuinely cares and at times seems excited to be a part of your enjoyment of the culinary delights they bring you.  Everything is about your enjoyment of a truly great meal.The chef and culinary team are creating tastes and bites among the finest anywhere.  The ingredients are carefully curated, often local, and often unique.  Always combined to produce what was for us, one of the best meals we have enjoyed anywhere in the country.  Of note amazing bites came from the onion crepe, the octopus, each and every bite of each pasta course and the capretto (which will have me asking the butcher how to find goat!).Thank you, to the entire staff, management and chef for the sincerity you have put into creating a great culinary experience."
5,5,5,5,Top 3 evening meals of our Life !!All aspects of fine dining were achieved and we anxiously await our opportunity to return Do Not miss your opportunity on your next visit to Philly!!
5,5,5,5,Brought friends for the first time. They said it was the best meal they鈥檝e ever had. Impossible to disagree with them.
5,5,5,5,"I dined solo to celebrate my 35th birthday at this fine establishment. My experience was nothing short of amazing! As a mostly vegan, the kitchen did an excellent job of preparing appropriate dishes & making things lighter on the dairy side. I even got a few bonus dishes that also rocked my taste buds! I'm a lover of exceptional service, so there's nothing like being served & constantly checked on by handsome men in suits & vests. I will definitely return!"
5,5,5,5,"Probably my favorite dining experience ever. Each course was delicious, the service was impeccable (Tara is wonderful), and the ambiance was warm and welcoming.The prosciutto, branzino and spinach gnocchi were standouts. The pistachio flan and caramel apple pastry were also excellent. I can鈥檛 say enough about how great dinner was. It is definitely a special occasion type place, but we will be sure to come back!"
5,5,5,5,It was remarkable! We ordered the wine pairing with all the dishes. I recommend that to enhance your experience. It was absolutely dreamy. Can鈥檛 wait to go back.
5,5,5,5,"We were there with friends celebrating my Wife鈥檚 birthday and everything was incredible.  From the service to the food to the wine pairings everything was amazing.  Top notch service, remembering names and food preferences throughout the night - and the food prep was easily one of the top meals in the city."
5,5,5,5,"This was our first time here, we had a beautiful experience,  from the moment we arrived we felt welcome, the food started to come out and our taste buds were not disappointed,  from the first to the last bit we thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful, the staff were so knowledgeable and friendly! Definitely worth a visit."
5,5,5,5,"everything was beyond amazing from the service to very bye of food. We did the wine pairing with the dinner and it was totally worth it. Definitely not an everyday dinner , loved it for a special occasion."
5,5,5,5,Vetri Cucina is a special occasion restaurant that exceeded my expectations! The tasting menu was customized to our liking and each and every bite was beyond delicious! Highly recommend!!!
5,5,5,5,"Incredible. Expect to spend $$$$,  but what an incredible dining experience."
3,3,5,4,"Maybe it has something to do with vetri not being there. This was the first time we visited a James beard nominee /winner that was not present. The waiter and hostess were  great, the food did not taste like James beard....."
5,5,5,5,"If you want exceptional Italian-inspired food, lighthearted yet attentive service, and a comforting setting, Vetri Cucina is for you. The house made artisan breads and pasta are superb! And anything served in or dipped in the brown butter sauce..."
5,5,5,5,"Tasting menu was creative, varied, and delicious. The service was friendly, helpful, and attentive."
5,5,5,5,Always an amazing experience
5,5,5,5,Beat meal of my life.  Outstanding in every way!
5,5,5,5,My husband really like it. They鈥檙e service are really good. They will never let your glass of water empty. Quick and really pay attention. We loved it.
3,3,4,3,The cost per person in comparison to the food was not worth it.
4,4,5,4,"Food was nice and service was wonderful, I was allowed to choose what I wanted from a large selection. I also like the Europe style decor and finish, but I think the restaurant is a little too loud and a little bit overpriced. For me, it was overall a good experience."
2,5,1,4,We were there for our
5,5,5,5,One of the most amazing meals I鈥檝e ever had.
5,5,5,5,"A flawless meal, as always. Pasta to die for!"
5,5,5,5,"Hands down the best fine dining experience I've ever had in Philadelphia, if not anywhere in the world.  The food is exquisitely executed and the service is friendly but not excessive."
4,4,4,5,It鈥檚 all about the pasta...and the sauces for everything else!
5,5,5,5,Everything was made to perfection!
5,5,5,5,Extraordinaria cocina
5,5,5,4,Service and food was excellent. The table of six nearby was loud but otherwise the ambiance was delightful. It felt like we were at someone鈥檚 home for an elegant dinner.
5,5,5,5,Unbelievable!! Best meal I have ever eaten. Excellent service. Very attentive but not smothering.
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I celebrated a wedding anniversary here last weekend.  We had heard a lot about the place and were not disappointed.  I would say that we were incredibly pleased with not only the food but with the service, the attentiveness, the attention to detail and the wine.  I had the wine pairing which was terrific.  Our server Bill could not have been friendlier, more knowledgeable and attentive without being obtrusive.  We will definitely go back."
3,3,3,3,Eh... not much more to say.
3,3,3,2,"When you鈥檙e supposed to be the top restaurant in Philadelphia, and you charge accordingly, you set a high bar for yourself. Unfortunately, it seems like Vetri is mostly riding on its reputation. The place has become a factory. The downstairs dining room is crammed with tables, and most of them are not very nice. There鈥檚 a huge bussing/coffee station in the middle of the small dining room. Two four tops abut the station, blocking in one of the diners at each table. And it鈥檚 loud. There is a ton of waiter traffic on the floor at all time, which does not allow for a relaxing, leisurely dining experience. In fact, it鈥檚 clear that the whole meal experience is designed around being able to have two seatings. By the time we left, the tiny vestibule was packed with people drinking cocktails waiting for the second seating. As far as the food, it was good. It didn鈥檛 seem like much of it was prepared a la minute 鈥 much of it felt like it was prepared ahead of time. In short, for a meal that costs over $300 per diner, we expected a much better dining experience. Not worth the price."
5,5,5,5,25th wedding anniversary- such an incredible night.  Did the wine pairing so Bill was pricey but so worth it for the experience.  Food was amazing as always and service is impeccable.
5,5,5,5,"Excellent everything!!  Food, service, ambiance, and attention to detail were superb.  Service harkened back to a more civilized time but was not pretentious.  Of course, the food was outstanding from the amuse bouche to the dessert - everything with a hint of the classic and very fresh ingredients with innovative touches.  Cannot wait to return!!"
5,5,5,5,Amazing as always. Expensive but worth every cent !
5,5,5,5,"This is simply one of the best restaurants in the U.S.  We travel from New York at least once a year to satisfy our craving for Vetri's pasta, the best this posta lover has ever eaten."
5,5,5,5,"Our second trip to Vetri did not disappoint! Everything was fantastic as you would expect given the ratings and price of the experience. Best dishes IMO were the prosciutto, swiss chard pasta and goat entree. We will definitely be back."
5,5,5,5,An amazing evening!
3,5,5,5,Excellent too much food I felt pushed to get the tasting menu.
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I go each year for our wedding anniversary. The dining experience is unlike any other restaurant in the city. The best experience comes from chefs personalized menu for each individual diner. The food is unreal, the wine list is unparalleled, and the staff is as knowledgeable as you will find. Very pricy but worth every single penny. It鈥檚 a must try for those who truly appreciate food and don鈥檛 mind spending the money."
4,4,2,5,"The food and atmosphere was great.  The service was just ok, not slow, just felt like we were putting them out with our order...."
1,4,1,4,Food and Ambiance good.  Service amongst the worst I have ever experienced
4,5,3,5,"I love the food and ambiance at Yvonne's, which is why I keep coming back!  I know they get busy on weekends, but I wish the waiters wouldn't rush the food out quite so fast.  It can feel like quick table turnover is being prioritized over dining experience."
5,5,5,5,Very cool ambience.  Fabulous cocktails and wine.  Outstanding service.  Will definitely be back next time I visit Boston!  Highly recommend!
5,5,5,5,Consistently good meal.  Usually quite bustling but nice and quiet on this Sunday night.
5,5,5,5,Amazing meal at Yvonnes! We had our first date here over a year ago and on this visit they somehow  managed to seat us at the same table. Yvonnes remains one of our favorite restaurants in Boston. Incredible food and ambiance.
5,5,5,5,BAMM!  Another great meal and dining experience... the staff is A-plus as is the food.  Viper CHOP..yummy.  Tater tots... so good and a reminder of childhood.  Just a great time all around ... if I had to change one thing it would be the new martini glasses (get back to traditional)...
5,5,5,5,"Matt was a great server,  enjoyed the experience, and sharing the small plates"
5,4,5,5,"We loved it.  The decor and overall ambiance were perfect.  We had an early dinner before a concert at the Orpheum Theater but it didn't feel early.  We sat at a good sized table in the library among the books and cool artwork.  The lighting is dim and comfortable and plenty of room at the table.  Atmosphere was loud but not too loud--I felt like we could talk without being overheard and vice versa.  They offer some really fun drinks.  I ordered one that was spiced up for the holidays.  Delicious, a little pricey, but justified for a night out in Boston.  We ordered several small plates and snacks.  Everything was delicious.  Easy walk to the concert afterward.  Highly recommend!"
3,3,4,4,"The room is elaborately decorated and evokes a speakeasy vibe. Service was attentive and friendly. That's it. The food was assertively mediocre. Not going back for food, but perhaps for drinks."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful meal. Inventive. Bustling atmosphere!
5,5,5,5,AMAZING SPOT!!
4,5,4,2,"Food was fantastic at Yvonne鈥檚 but the ambiance was sub-par.  Very noisy Restuarant, more like a club than a place for a romantic dinner.  Food was outstanding."
4,5,5,3,"Great food, and  service.... INSANE noise level for a Wednesday at 6:30pm.    Great for friends dinner, but not for a business or casual-catch-up-over- dinner."
5,5,4,5,We loved Yvonne鈥檚 馃槉馃憤馃徎
4,5,3,5,"The ambiance was excellent and the food wonderful! Loved the tuna. The only complaint I have is the slow service that night. No menus, no water and no attention until we had to (friendly) ask for attention three times until one of the waitresses actually attended to our table."
5,5,5,5,"We went here for my birthday on a busy Saturday night and Michael our waiter was outstanding! He was friendly, super helpful, and attentive. If we could request him again next time we would! As always, the food, drinks, and atmosphere were perfect!"
5,5,5,5,The food was amazing and the staff was very professional. Defiantly good for a special occasion or a date. Defiantly going to be recommending this place to my friends!
5,5,5,5,Everything was wonderful. Specialty cocktail presentation was awesome!
5,5,4,5,"First time at Yvonne鈥檚 for a date. Great experience overall, we grabbed drinks at the bar and were seated per reservation once the time came. The service was good and the drinks and food were outstanding. Will come back!"
2,3,2,1,Our experience began when the uber driver was late and dropped is off in the wrong block.  Made a courtesy call at 8:02 that we might run 10 late for our 8pm Friday evening res. A very rude voice said "well if you dont get here within tje 15 minute grace we will give the table away.  Arrived with 3 minitea to spare!   After being seated - the table wobbled like a bobblehead and needed to me fixed. I asked for a quiet table through the app. Now this is a noisy venue but to have the only  2top between 2 aiz tops but he with gaggles of drunk screaming women made hearing my partner impossible. At all!The food was passable but served randomly. I get it is tapas bit some thought please. Nothing was warmer than room temperature and obviously prepared an mass earlier.  The beet salad had virtually no beets other than a couple tiny slivers.  The only highlight was a $38 glass of Rodney Strong Cabernet Savigon which was heavenly despite the spilled pour onto the table.  Infact everyone who poured anything spilled some in a rushNo attention to detail - all rush. Cheap check only $135 with tip and wine
4,4,4,5,"Fun atmosphere! Good food, attentive service , definitely a bar scene on the periphery of one dining area - so lots of energy- will return"
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food, amazing ambience and fun times!"
5,5,5,5,"This is one of my favorite places to dine in Boston. They have a fun and eclectic cocktail menu, and the surrounding ambiance makes it all the more enjoyable. I'll definitely be coming back here again!"
5,5,5,5,"My favorite restaurant in Boston.  Great food, cocktails, service, and ambiance.  In my book can't do better."
5,5,5,5,Our server Cassandra was wonderful! The food was perfect and we appreciated the tour of downstairs!
5,5,5,5,Absolutely amazing! We were celebrating our daughter鈥檚 birthday!  Lovely and exquisite!! Our server was fantastic! Our new favourite restaurant x
5,5,5,5,Visited my son who started a new job in Boston. I traveled from Maryland.  My husband helped move my son to Boston in June and they ate here. They both loved it and so I took my son there on this visit. The restaurant is a 鈥渟peak Easy鈥. A hidden jewel down a little side street. I was amazed at the architectural beauty of this restaurant! Every room is prettier than the next and the food and service are first class. Everyone should experience this restaurant!
5,5,3,5,"Made a late night reservation and was told that I couldn鈥檛 sit in the dining room if we weren鈥檛 having a full dinner, reallllly wish this information was posted somewhere. Thankfully my group was able to be sat in the lounge. They also missed the birthday note on the reservation."
5,5,5,5,Highly recommend the Tuna!!
4,5,2,4,Food is always delicious - service was slow
3,5,1,4,"The food was simply incredible. The menu - and each menu item - is a testament to creativity and culinary adventure. The execution was masterful. This is a restaurant for foodies, epicures, cooks... basically any food lovers. But you may well have to endure (or overlook) some really inexcusable gaffes. The cocktail menu is clever, but it seemed like the drinks were made by someone who doesn鈥檛 realize there鈥檚 a reason for actually measuring each ingredient. That heavy-handedness was especially evident when ordering a repeat that tasted notably different... same ingredients but clearly different proportions (and served in a completely different type of glass). The service was unreasonably bad. Frankly, the inarticulate and seemingly disinterested hostess should have been the warning sign. While our server was friendly and welcoming, she took our orders and then disappeared. We would not see her for another hour. Her disappearance didn鈥檛 really matter to us 鈥攖he food was brought by a parade of different people (each conveying a level of happy-to-be-here that you鈥檇 expect from an indentured worker) and that drink 鈥渞efill鈥 order was taken by some guy in a suit. The food, however, was superb. At some point after plates had been cleared, another guy in a suit appeared (unprompted) offering a convoluted apology for why one of our dishes had not made it to the table... followed by a cameo appearance from our waitress who shrugged her shoulders while saying something about a mixup.The place itself is cool 鈥 although more a caricature of 鈥渃ool鈥... which makes for an energetic and entertaining spot. The food is remarkable, but sadly undermined by the junior varsity level of service. We鈥檒l certainly try again... maybe it was just an anomaly. Maybe."
5,5,5,5,Great place. Great atmosphere. Tuna was off the hook good.
5,5,5,5,Wow!!! What an experience! This is a very energetic wonderful restaurant. The decor is fabulous. The service was amazing and the food was exceptional. Love all the original cocktails. Definitely on my list to go back when I'm back in town.
1,1,1,1,Worst experience of my life rude manager Bruno  and waitress
5,5,5,5,The menu is outstanding and the ambiance is incredible!
4,4,4,3,It is kind of dark and table was really small. Other than that service and food was good.
5,5,5,4,A really cool vibe and atmosphere. Food is tapas style and allows for lots of variety at one sitting. Service was attentive and very helpful with choices.
3,4,3,4,"We had a great night? Food was spectacular but one dish was extremely undercooked, it was pork with kimchee rice, had it in the past, we sent it back, it came back out still raw.  The waitress told us 鈥渢hat鈥檚 the way we cook it鈥 with a real attitude.  Up until then she was great, but that put a bad taste in my mouth.  Previously we were there and our server made the night!!  It鈥檚 a great place with delicious food, but waitstaff can make or break the evening.  Drinks were amazing on a very positive note"
5,5,5,5,Awesome place
5,0,0,0,Amazing food. the lamb was cooked to perfection
5,5,5,5,"We absolutely love coming to Zahav! Our only complaint is the wait time for a reservation but it is for good reason, this is THE place to eat in Philly! My husband and I have been several times and most recently took our parents to enjoy the experience. If you are looking for true Israeli cuisine, this is the place for you! The food is beyond delicious, authentic and the overall vibe of the restaurant is fun and fresh. You won't be disappointed!"
5,5,5,5,One of the best meals you鈥檒l have (possibly ever) hands down. It鈥檚 worth it for the food alone but the service is impeccable.
3,2,4,3,"I'm not sure if we were there on an off service night but from when we arrived to when we left our experience was less than stellar.  You arrive & its quite chaotic, table wasn't ready upon arrival for our reservation for us & many others waiting in front of us.  Our server was the highlight of the night, she was great throughout our experience.  One of the items we came for was the famous Slow Cooked Lamb Shoulder.  When asked about it for the tasting menu, we were told they were out already, for a 7:30 reservation which is ridiculous when you can get bar seating without reservations earlier & can order it.  Our experience continued downhill from there.  Drinks took forever to come out & our food was coming out under cooked, over cooked & cold as we watched the table next to us who sat down 15 minutes after us & took forever to place their order get their food before us having also ordered the tasting menu.  Our steak looked well done while theirs came out right after ours looking as if it was just pulled off the grill.  They left & paid before us.  The ""pusher"" responsible for reviewing & releasing the food wasn't doing a great job.  We watched tables around us get food at completely random times with long waits, short wait & no cadence.  The food was rather forgetabble. We have an Israeli restuarant in Chicago that across the board all their dishes were better especially for the price.  The hot hummus was the best part of the meal.  Reservations are so hard to get & the fact you don't get asked during your reservation if you are interested in their signature dish would make one assume you can't request ahead of time but first come first serve.  There is no information regarding any of this on their website.  If you are going for that dish, get a bar seat or make 5pm reservations.  We are fortunate to travel all over the world & try all types of local food but for us a place with so much hype we would not recommend to our friends based on our overall experience."
1,2,1,2,There is not enough text space in this dialog box to fully explain the horrendous experience. The service is the main root of the problem. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in my adult life whilst eating at out at a restaurant.
5,5,3,4,"Great food, but slow service. Your food will come before your drinks. There is an overall attitude problem here. The waitstaff should take it down a peg or two. The food is the star here, not you. No excuses."
5,5,5,5,"Our favorite restaurant in the city for the past 7 years! Unique, delicious food and top notch staff."
3,3,3,3,A little off this time. We were served burnt bread and the waiter did not return back to check on our first course.
5,5,5,5,"Really good and interesting food . The tasting menu is almost too much food and we were given an extra vegetable serving, an extra small plate and an extra dessert. The wine pairing was also very good. The next time we go, we will order the hummus and several small plates."
5,5,5,4,We had a wonderful dinner celebrating our wedding anniversary. The staff wished us congratulations and we had specially printed menus just for us.  The food is terrific. Their hummus is the best anywhere The lamb with the pomegranate molasses glaze was heavenly. My only complaint is that the music was a little loud at times. What a memorable dinner.
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food and service.  My son is gluten free and they had the menu already adjusted for his dietary needs upon arrival.  Wait staff very attentive .  Interesting, highly flavorful food!  Tasting menu allows you to try many different things!"
5,5,5,5,"Exceptional? Nah, this was an otherworldly meal. I鈥檝e been talking about it since I first tasted the hummus. Without exaggerating this was one of the best meals I鈥檝e ever had."
5,5,5,5,Awesome restaurant!!!
5,5,5,5,Easily one of the top 3 best meals I鈥檝e ever had. They made my birthday so special with a specialized menu and complimentary ros茅.
5,5,5,5,We chose chef's selection and it was fantastic. We loved the element of surprise and each choice was perfectly selected for us. Definitely recommend this option especially if you are open for a food adventure.
5,5,5,4,"The meal and service are impeccable. Found a really nice (and reasonable) Lebanese red wine to go with the tasting menu (which is really the only way to go). Table location was ideal (not in the more crowded set of tables). Just a tad warm--although it was a super hot day. Already have the next reservation for next month. Combo of quality, inventiveness, price and service can't really be beat."
5,4,5,5,"I've dined at Zahav numerous times. We made a reservation this past time for my birthday. I have a few food allergies and they curated a menu specifically for me based on this knowledge. It was very thoughtful and really put a smile on my face. Two of the dishes out of many ordered were over-salted to our taste buds and this was never an issue in the past. Overall, I love Zahav and would definitely recommend!"
5,5,5,4,"This our second time at Zahav.  The food is simple but outstanding.  Great interpretations of Israeli classics.  At $48 per person, the tasting menu is a great value.  More than enough food, plenty of choices, and dessert is included.  The wait staff is friendly and helpful.  They know the food and how to explain it.  I highly recommend Zahav."
5,5,5,5,The restaurant was amazing! The food was incredible! We enjoyed celebrating our anniversary there as they made it really special!
5,5,5,4,Amazing experience. The food was out of this world!
5,4,5,4,Birthday with wifeFirst timeVery good experience Best hummus everExcellent service
4,5,5,4,"Our party of four ordered the tasting menu. The meal was excellent. We loved the great variety of dishes and interesting flavors. The servers were extremely friendly and attentive. The space is attractive, too. Also, I appreciated the personalized birthday message on the menu for my daughter and the birthday greetings from the waitstaff. There was only one problem which detracted significantly from our experience: the noise level. The music was so loud (and not particularly interesting or cool) that we couldn鈥檛 hear ourselves talk. We couldn鈥檛 even hear the servers trying to carefully explain the contents of each dish, which was a real bummer. I asked a few times for them to repeat what they said, but then I just gave up. We were very interested in knowing about each dish and chatting about that at dinner. That is kind of the point of a tasting menu. Having a crazy loud space doesn鈥檛 make it more happening, in my opinion."
5,5,5,5,LOVED EVERYTHING!!!
5,5,5,5,We loved the tasting menu! We could not believe how many different dishes we were able to sample. And they were all delicious!  The only draw back is how hard it is to get a reservation.
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food, beverages, and service, as ever! Thank you!"
5,4,5,5,The Hummus is to DIE for. Would come back just for that. Everything else was also very good. The service was amazing. Very attentive. I can see why Zahav was names best restaurant in the country! Definitely a must try
4,3,4,5,A little disappointed.  Food was very salty.
5,5,5,5,Thank You!
5,5,5,4,The food was amazing and the service was top notch.  The price wasn't bad at all. For $48 per person you can try nearly everything on the menu with 2 people.
5,5,5,5,The hanger steak was a great second option since they were out of the lamb shoulder (sad face) Everything was so delicious and the wait staff was friendly and efficient!
5,5,5,5,"Superb! Always a treat to eat there; incredible food and top notch service. Best of all, as busy as they are, you're not rushed through a meal in order to turn a table; in other words, leisurely dining!"
5,5,5,5,"We went here with my parents because they wanted to try Zahav. My husband and parents beat me there (since I had to work). I was happy that they were able to be seated prior to my arrival. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. The food was amazing and they had a good amount of vegetarian options. The drinks were super tasty as well! They offer small plates and they are pretty filling. The hummus is a must get. My dad hates hummus and he even said that this was the only hummus he鈥檚 ever had that actually tasted good. If we weren鈥檛 so stuffed, I definitely would鈥檝e tried the dessert, but maybe next time!"
5,5,5,5,Been here like 10 times. Always amazing!!!
5,5,5,5,"How could you describe this restaurant as anything but amazing. From the Turkish hummus (a must order!!) to the desserts, we had some of the best food I鈥檝e ever eaten. The only miss was the Lamb tartar which was significantly over salted. Put this restaurant on your list to try, and you will not regret it!"
5,5,5,5,"Superb food, exceptional service!"
5,5,5,5,Always a great experience! Excellent food and excellent service!
5,5,5,5,"Everything was fantastic, highly recommended"
5,5,5,4,Everyone must try this restaurant! It is just simply one of the best dining experiences out there. The only tiny downside is just how busy and loud it is but this is understandable! Everyone wants to be there for good reason!
5,5,5,5,Amazing flavors! Take the tasting menu with the wine pairing.
5,5,5,5,Worth the hype. Great food and atmosphere. Service was impeccable
5,5,5,5,"Though we thought expensive, the execution of food and service was superb creating value appropriate for the price.  Server food knowledge and descriptions excellent.  Wine paring thoughtful, delicious."
4,5,4,5,"We loved the food at Zero and the outdoor setting was lovely. I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that it was all a little precious. And why is the 4-course $65 menu not presented?  We knew about it from going online but then no sight of it. Then we鈥檙e told it鈥檚 a pre-theater menu. Pre-theater in Charleston???  Just how many theaters are there in Charleston? (We鈥檙e from NY.). That said, the food we had was delicious."
5,5,5,5,We were able to do their Saturday evening tasting menu.  It was amazing.  The chef was a wizard with the flavors and the pairings were excellent.  This is a must-do for foodies visiting Charleston.
5,5,5,5,"This is a very special restaurant, unlike any we've experienced in Charleston. They have a multi-course tasting menu - only - so there's not a menu with a plethora of choices. But everything we were served was phenomenal; dreamed up and prepared by a true culinary genius. The service was some of the best we've experienced anywhere.  Every service person was 100% professional and accommodating, while also being engaging and warm. There is no other place like this in Charleston. With high-end food and service, physical comfort and delightful ambiance, it has quickly moved into the #1 slot of our ""Favorite restaurants in Charleston"" list! The only caveat I might mention is that each course is tiny. We left very satisfied but were hungry about three hours later. Even so, we can't wait to go back!"
5,5,5,5,Our last night in Charleston was an incredible dinner at Zero George.... from the drinks... to the service...to the setting... To the AMAZING Dinner... Highly recommend.
5,5,5,5,"We had an excellent experience at Zero Restaurant.  The food was immaculate, but it was the service that really stood out to me.  Everyone from the hostess to the bartender to the waiters was friendly, knowledgeable, accommodating, and pleasant.  It is not easy to find a restaurant where the caliber of food and service match.  I look forward to returning to Zero and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend."
5,5,5,5,"This is an outstanding restaurant. The food, service and charming atmosphere add up to a wonderful evening. We make a point to dine there whenever we are  in Charleston. I am not an ""adventurous"" eater, but I eat everything from the chef's menu and it never fails to wow me."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful experience all the way around!! Very Romantic setting and a culinary adventure
5,5,5,5,Excellent food excellent service very pricey Their website doesn鈥檛 disclose they are an exclusive price fixe menu that part is disappointingAll staff are very knowledgeable about the food and wine Cozy
5,5,5,5,"The food was exceptional as always and I have ranted and ravedAfter each experience here.  However, it was a bit unnerving to have a very loud and inconsiderate table of 4 (clearly not locals...as determined by their accent and lack of dining room etiquette) in the middle of the very intimate and not-sound-proofed dining area.I know we are all there for the ambiance and the food, and despite anyones 鈥渙ccasion鈥...if we are having a meal and  spending upwards of 400$ for a dinner for 2, I would expect that a manager would politely request a loud and noisy group to tone it down. I enjoy a good time and can get loud but this is not the place.Regards and see you soon"
5,5,5,5,"It was very very good. Lovely. Would love to stay there sometime too. We were a little surprised by the price at the end, but overall a very memorable experience."
3,4,1,2,Did not appreciate the car salesmen up sell on the wine option.
4,5,2,5,We were there on. Monday night and the restaurant was not crowded.  I felt like the service was rushed because the staff wanted to get us out of there due to it being a Monday night.  The food was incredible and the obeisance was great.
5,5,4,4,"We quite enjoyed the event,a little more than what we normally spend.But were pleased,service was excellent.Food well presented,tasty and healthy"
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and great experience overall.  It鈥檚 pretty pricey though so save it for a special occasion.  Worth every penny!!
5,5,5,5,Amazing... spectular ..food ..service ..wine our 4th time at Zero George in  the last 3 years.
5,5,5,5,"I believe this is the  greatest dining experience in Charleston. Classy, delicious, and elegantly prepared dishes. Both elevated and standard wines paired perfectly. Wish they were in Cali too."
5,5,5,5,"We came to Zero Restaurant to celebrate my birthday dinner his last weekend and loved every aspect of our meal, service and overall experience. We have visited several times before and absolutely love this restaurant and staff so much. I highly recommend visisting and dining here, if you appreciate innovative and exciting food this will quickly become your favorite restaurant. It is decadent and sophisticated...yet still approachable."
5,5,5,5,Went here with some friends and it was phenomenal!  Drinks were awesome and the food was extraordinary!  The design and decor is inviting and when you walk in - you know you鈥檙e in a special place. This is a very eclectic and wonderful place to eat. If you鈥檙e looking for something special that鈥檚 intimate - this is it!  It鈥檒l set you back a few bucks but you won鈥檛 be dissapointed!
4,3,5,5,The ambiance is great and the staff was very friendly and competent.  The food was very interesting but I was disappointed that the only option presented was a tasting menu.  We didn鈥檛 have adequate time before the show to fully experience multiple courses. They were gracious and allowed us to come back for coffee after our performance.
5,5,5,5,"The food was so delicious and fresh; I'm vegetarian, and they accommodated me beautifully.  A very special and unique restaurant."
4,5,4,5,We were shown only the five course meal and we had to ask for the 3 course.
5,5,5,5,"The small dining room is an intimate, tasteful setting.  The food is extraordinarily creative - delicious, but also fun to explore new flavor combinations."
5,5,4,5,"Of Nordic heritage and a lover of the Nordic style of fine dining, I thoroughly enjoyed Zero. The tasting menu in itself and the relaxed pace with which the meal took place was something I was looking for. The food is very good; too much happening at times for a Nordic taste, but still above the default. Really fine wine pairing. The one thing to note is the out-of-step timing btw the food and the wine on several occasions."
5,5,5,5,Last vacation day in Charleston
5,5,5,5,The food and wine pairing was outstanding! The proportions were perfect since they were so many courses. Prior to dinner we had a drink at the bar. The cosmopolitan was perfect and pink! I loved the culinary experience!
5,5,5,5,"The food was different than usual cuisine, however it was the best food I have ever eaten. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to eat the best food the south has to offer."
5,5,5,4,"Zero Restaurant + Bar is such a unique dining experience that it鈥檚 difficult to even describe. Just buckle and prepare for a crazy ride. From the initial snacks that include a potted plant, to a red cabbage and chicken liver dish that will make you always want to eat your veggies, to the most unique interpretation you鈥檝e ever seen on 鈥渟hrimp and grits鈥, to the perfectly cooked Beef Wellington with foie gras, this tasting menu is one to not miss. The ambiance is romantic and relaxed at the same time. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The chef is quick to make any needed adjustments to make the experience more enjoyable for his guests. Do not miss this hidden gem on your next trip to Charleston."
5,5,5,5,I think I could just as easily communicate how I feel by posting the 鈥渄rool鈥 emoji. Amazing food. Amazing service. We鈥檒l be back. You should go.
5,5,5,4,"Truly memorable meal. Long but delicious. All dishes were great, wine pairings terrific too."
5,5,5,5,We鈥檝e gone to Zero George several times and it is always a special experience.
4,4,4,3,Alvin Ailey at gaillard
5,5,5,5,"Exquisite service and food, PERIOD. Wine parings for the different entrees were perfect. Portions perfect. Food amazing. What a wonderful dinning experience. For me, the price was worth it food the food and service. Top Notch!"
5,5,5,5,Visiting Charleston
5,5,5,5,"One of the most amazing meals I have ever had. Dinner will set you back but the whole experience was top notch start to finish. Staff was friendly and accommodating, service was amazing and knowledgeable about their food and drinks. Food was incredible and innovative. The way fine dining should be."
4,3,4,4,The food presentation was nice but some servings were missing the flavor.  The potted plant was intriguing and fun but was quite bland.  Koji cured hamachi was good but surrounded by very acidic sauce.  We were hoping for a true wow factor but didn't quite get that.
5,5,5,5,College of Charleston roommate reunion
3,3,5,5,"Zero restaurant is beautiful and has cozy ambiance in what felt like a historic southern home. The service was amazing and their sommelier was very knowledgeable. Chef made accommodations based on my boyfriend's eating limitations and was thoughtful about it. However, I would not recommend this restaurant mainly based on value.  For what we paid, we expected to be completely blown away. If the price had been lower, we would've been much more impressed, but given how expensive it was, this should have been an unforgettable meal. However, during our weekend in Charleston, we had two much better dining experiences that were much better value. All of the dishes at Zero were very much style over substance. Unique and artsy plating could not make up for how ordinary all of the food was at a place that tries very hard to be extraordinary."
5,5,5,5,Truly exceptional. The food and wine pairings were perfect and the staff knowledge really helped magnify the experience. One of the best meals we鈥檝e eaten anywhere
5,5,4,5,"Outstanding experience. Unique and surprising courses, with perfect pairings. Only complaint is that we had to often ask the waiter to repeat himself because he spoke to fast when describing the courses."
