5,5,5,5,"A perfect restaurant, in terms of ambience, service drink, and food.Our servers were very knowledgeable and skilled  about the menu and gracious hospitality."
5,5,5,5,Always good . one of the best in the Hamptons you can even hear everyone at the table which is rare these days.
4,3,5,5,"We would go every few months but instead go every few years simply to see if things have changed with the food preparation. They have not.  The menu always tempts but the food is always under-flavored, (not just under-seasoned, which some dishes are), and yet the salad is always too salty.   Frustrating because we are strongly drawn to this elegant room, comforting yet sophisticated inn ambience, superb service, good wine choices, well-made drinks, lovely venue."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely loved the ambiance and charm of 1770. Waiter was very knowledgeable of food and wine recommendations. The food was amazing we will definitely return !
5,5,5,5,I love the chicken cooked to perfection on its bed of delicate mushed potatoes the sticky dates cales is out of this world.
5,5,5,5,Our meal and service were both excellent
5,5,5,5,"1770 House continues to be East Hamptons best restaurant....Creative menu, great service and a sensational value during restaurant week."
5,5,5,5,Best place in East Hampton. They are consistently lovely. The food was delicious a wonderful dinning experience. Recommend highly.
5,5,5,5,Such a cozy place and wonderful staff! The food is delicious! They just need to have a heavier pour with wine. That鈥檚 my only suggestion.
5,5,5,5,"1770 House was fabulous, as usual. Going there for Restaurant Week made it a tremendous bargain. I still would highly recommend it even when it is not Restaurant Week."
5,5,5,5,Delightful. Food delicious. Service perfect. We had a very enjoyable evening.
5,5,5,5,"We have eaten at 1770 House before.  It has always been a true fine dining experience.  The service was perfect, and the food delicious.  The main dining room is charming and uncrowded.  The 1770 refers to when the building became an inn, the building itself dates back to the 1600鈥檚.  It is usually fairly expensive, but a tremendous bargain for restaurant week.  One of the best for a truly special occasion."
4,4,5,5,Nice quiet restaurant but for an one of the more expensive restaurants the menu is much too limited
5,5,5,5,Consistently a wonderful experience. I enjoy it above most places in the Hamptons.
5,5,5,5,"Had lovely, quiet, low-key dinner with great food. Wine list a bit pricey."
5,5,5,5,"One of our favorite places!  Great food, atmosphere & service."
5,5,5,5,We took our family there for a special gathering and the only negative thing I can say is that the parking was a little challenging. There is no parking lot so  during the weekend so it鈥檚 a little hard to find a parking spot and if your parked on the other side of the road pedestrian crossing is challenging! The food was absolutely delicious and we were honored to have a visit from the executive chef who gave us some personal al recommendations! I鈥檓 sorry we ate so much we had no room for dessert!
4,4,5,5,The homemade fettuccine was excellent. We ate in the tavern which was a more relaxed atmosphere. Friends had the meatloaf and veal cheeks which they said were good. The pork ribs were also good however the swordfish was dry and not up to par.
5,5,5,5,"THE  STAFF FROM THE MOMENT WE WALKED IN WAS SO COMFORTING AND FRIENDLY AND HOSPITABLE LIKE GOING TO TOUR FAVORITE FAMILY MEMBERS HOUSE THE BEAUTIFUL FIRE PLACES THE WOOD WORK WAS BEAUTIFUL ,THE FOOD WAS PREPARED PERFECT AND TASTED LIKE IT WAS CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN DURING THE COMING HOLIDAYS"
5,5,5,5,It was excellent!  Never been disappointed.  One of our favorite places to dine.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing experience from start to finish. The quality and presentation of the food was excellent and our server was very professional and personable.  We really enjoyed everything about the 1770 house and it鈥檚 staff.  And to top it off, after a memorable meal we loved sitting in the great room in front of the fire."
5,5,5,5,Serene and lovely restaurant in a classic inn. Food impeccable. Service charming  and unobtrusive.  Wine list excellent with many reasonably priced bottles.
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding dining experience. Came as a group of 8 with a toddler and two young kids for a birthday. The service was excellent and very accommodating of the children. The food was terrific, and we sampled justed about everything. I highly recommend 1770 House to celebrate any memorable event. A wonderful evening"
5,5,5,5,"I have been dying to try the 1770 House for years .. What an amazing meal! The service was impeccable and the staff friendly, knowledgeable and professional.  We were in the Tavern, as I wanted to try the meatloaf. I made this recipe from Ina Garten and thought it was delicious! So we went to the source 馃榿 the oysters in the half shell were fresh and tasty with the mignonette sauce. Dessert was just perfect, we had warm cider donuts with cinnamon icecream and pumpkin creme brulee.  Along with the quant ambiance, an all around amazing experience! Looking forward to our next visit!"
4,4,5,5,"Excellent wines by the glass. Seafood dishes (local fluke tartare and sea scallops) highly recommendable, unremarkable green salad and slightly overcooked chitarra pasta with meatballs that were good, but not more. Very friendly and competent service, cozy ambiance."
5,5,5,5,"1770 House is always excellent.  Some standard menu items are as reliable as one would wish.  There are also delicious surprises lurking, well worth trying.  Hard to avoid overeating!"
5,5,5,5,A totally professional restaurant with the best cooked food
5,5,5,5,"Everything was outstanding.  One of the best dining experiences since I moved here in June. Perfectly attentive waitstaff. Warm, expansive welcome. Historical interior and beautifully landscaped exterior. Entrees delectably cooked and presented with visual panache. Is our new go-to for special occasions."
5,5,5,5,"Always a lovely and delicious experience. A beautiful setting, attentive wait staff and wonderfully prepared food"
4,5,3,4,"Table was not ready, had to wait approximately 20mins (like everyone else). Service was mechanical"
3,4,2,3,"The manager Michael Cohen was very unprofessional and rude when we asked him to lower the AC which was on our face. Other than him the staff is fine.This is good place that should cater to their customers, the manager doesn鈥檛 have a clue."
5,5,5,5,"1770 has been our 鈥済o-to鈥 restaurant on the East End for many years now. Fabulous ambiance, food, and service."
5,4,5,5,"Great service. Exceptional...we had the lovely young man with the great radio voice. Food was good. Although I was still hungry afterwards. :) We has the matcha creme br没l茅e which was the only gluten free option. We enjoy it, didn鈥檛 leave any food uneaten. The mixed greens salad was super basic, only greens a few cherry tomatoes and dressing."
3,5,5,2,Amazing food .Amazing service. Just a bit too stuffy in the main dining room. Felt like we couldn鈥檛 relax . Tavern needs it鈥檚 own separate reservation and was not aware .
5,5,4,5,"1770 never disappoints. After all the restaurants have come and gone, 1770 still has the best food in town. My favorite destination!"
5,5,5,5,Excellent. Fluke is not to be missed as an appetizer. Scallops were excellent as well asthe service. Great classy place.
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding, as always!  Carol, you are doing such a first rate job.  Our (consistently) favorite restaurant i the Hamptons."
5,5,5,5,"Everything was lovely. Service excellent, the drinks were perfectly crafted. Dinner was delicious and we were not rushedWaiter very kind and patient with great sense of humor especially when I accidentally insulted him."
5,5,5,5,Always excellent. Food is consistently perfect and a nice blend of seasonal items and favorites
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food and experience! We will definitely come back, can鈥檛 recommend enough!"
5,5,5,5,"This was, far and away, the best meal I have ever eaten.  I would recommend it to anyone to mark a special occasion. The wait staff was knowledgeable and attentive.  Every detail was perfect - and delicious!"
5,4,5,5,My favorite restaurant of all time. I have been there tons of times and am never dissapoonted!
5,5,5,5,It is a dining experience not just any lunch or dinner out. Everything my friend and I sampled was like a party in your mouth. Awesomely delicious!
5,5,5,5,Another incredible meal and experience can鈥檛 wait to come back. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Our friends said it truly tasted like so much care was put into each and every bite.  Spectacular!
4,5,5,2,The food was fabulous. The wait staff very polite and efficient. The noise level was awful. Conversation was made with much effort. Sometimes we could not hear the description of the food the waitstaff was saying. If I go again it would be at an off peak time so we could enjoy each other鈥檚 company as well as the wonderful  food.
5,5,4,5,"I love the full experience.  Each item on the menu has a unique combination of seasonal flavors.  Everything is special.  The staff are very knowledgeable.  And, the restaurant and menu are sensitive to dietary restrictions (gluten-free, in my case) - with many choices that work."
5,5,5,5,The food was amazing. The menu has a great variety to suit every taste. Service is excellent. Our server was very personable and helpful. Fine dining in a warm and cozy setting. Perfect for any special celebration. I can鈥檛 wait to go back!
5,5,5,5,"Service was impeccable. Food was fantastic, I dined on the Grilled Prime Strip Steak with Black Garlic Crust prepared Medium Rare best I ever had. My significant other ordered the Rohan Duck Breast Glazed with Apple Cider Syrup prepared Medium Rare cooked just right. The comment was would order that again. We shared the Valrhona Chocolate Trio. Compliments to all the staff."
5,5,5,5,Loved it! The entire experience was amazing!
5,5,5,5,Best restaurant in Connecticut period. Congratulations.
5,5,5,4,"2nd visit. The food is outstanding, and in most cases, different from what you might normally experience at a high-end restaurant in Litchfield County CT. Arethusa is is on a par with the best in NYC. We were seated immediately at the time of the reservation. We shared Beausoleil oysters from New Brunswick, that were excellent. Wife had their vegetarian ravioli, which was terriffic and I had the short ribs, also wonderful.This is a loud space, but there was sufficeint space between tables so much of the sound became background noise. Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. We'll be going back!"
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and lovely lunch!
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food as always, friendly atmosphere and a leisurely meal with dear friends."
5,5,5,2,The quality of the food was incredible. The service was impeccable. Price for lunch was very expensive
5,5,5,5,Everyone was very accommodating and the food was delicious. All the servers were knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations. We will definitely be dining here again!
4,3,5,5,This was our first time at this restaurant. We drove an hour to get to the restaurant as we heard this was an amazing place. The octopus and arugula salad were very good.  My husband ordered the steak which was very average. I got scallop which was very good. We for the fall desert which we didn鈥檛 like at all. The service was excellent though. I don鈥檛 think we will go there again given the distance and good but not great food.
5,5,5,5,One of the best restaurants I鈥檝e been to! Everything was perfect.
5,5,5,5,"Our dinner at Arethusa al Tavolo was simply amazing.  The servers were wonderful, the food was fantastic, the ambiance was delightful.  I will be returning and would recommend to a friend/family member."
5,5,5,5,"We鈥檝e been here several times and each time the entire experience has been fantastic. This time we brought family to celebrate a birthday. As usual the food was outstanding with beautiful presentation. Everyone in our party raved about the food. In addition, the service was outstanding."
5,5,5,5,"We loved it!!  Food was excellent, beautiful display, loved the extras!  We look forward to going back soon."
5,5,5,5,I came from Kansas City to spend the weekend with my daughter who lives in New Haven. Enjoy a day of fall foliage and fine dining with a visit to the dairy farm. It felt like home.
5,5,5,5,As always a wonderful dining experience. Words can not do justice for the overall experience.
5,5,5,5,The staff and food were outstanding.  They made my birthday very special!
5,5,5,5,"This meal was a 鈥10鈥 on all accounts鈥 the taste, quality, presentation, and service. It was one of the best meals I鈥檝e had in my entire life. The one slight downside was the noise level in the room, but everything else was so fantastic we forgot about the noise. We will definitely be back when we want a very special dining experience."
5,5,5,4,"We were seated to a great table by the front window, the service was friendly and very attentive. The table next to ours was quite close and the party of three were very loud. The food however made up for the noise big time.  Presentation was artistic, the flavors perfect on the palate.  A delicious night."
5,5,5,5,We had an anniversary dinner at Arethusa al Tavolo and we had such a great experience.  The food was all amazing and we were very impressed with all the flavors of the dishes.  The butter alone was extremely good!  The service was excellent and they even gave us a handwritten card for our anniversary celebration.  We could definitely come back!
5,5,5,5,Our food was delicious and the service perfect.we will be back!
5,5,5,4,"Absolutely delicious! The gluten free bread is savory and fabulous, I totally loved the beet soup and short rib ravioli. Can鈥檛 wait to return!"
5,5,5,5,"Lovely evening - very pleasant, knowledgeable staff and fabulous food."
5,5,5,5,Overall amazing food and service. Highly recommend.
5,5,5,5,Everything was great the food and the staff were great.
5,5,5,5,"food is delicious and beautifully present, service very friendly, attentive and efficient."
5,5,5,5,Amazing food! Had the halibut and the hamachi. Both amazing
5,5,4,4,Probably the best meal I鈥檝e ever had in Connecticut. Congratulations.
5,5,3,5,"Meal from apps to dessert was fabulous. The chicken liver dumplings were absolutely delicious.  I also had the halibut entree which also was so so good. So many other dishes we want to try. We have always had the best service you could ask for here, but on Wednesday night, our waitress was just ok. We waited over 35 min for dessert and during that time she never came to our table to explain why. Very disappointing!! Acted like it was our problem."
5,5,5,4,Wonderful food and service! Can鈥檛 wait to go again and try something different. Food was excellently prepared and absolutely delicious.
5,5,5,5,"Went on a Sunday night. From the moment we walked in we were treated well. Staff were great in explaining the drink and food options. Given the great reviews, I expected a mis step. There were none. All the apps and mains were perfect. Scallops and salmon were cooked to perfection. Each item had its own flavor profile and didn鈥檛 take away from the protein. Manager was nice enough to warn me about the deer in the area. Can鈥檛 wait to return."
5,5,5,5,"We've already recommended Arethusa to others.  Consistently outstanding on all fronts.  Creative, delicious food, super attentive staff without being overbearing, clean kitchen...they just knocked it out of the park (again).Sorry for only giving it 4 out of 5 on the value metric.  That's because I'm a cheap SOB.  I will say that if you are going to pay a lot for a meal it better be memorable.  I recently had a number of expensive meals in Napa at notable restaurants and was unhappy with all of them...Arethusa is memorable and I have never come away unhappy.  Great job everyone."
5,5,5,5,"This is the best restaurant in the area.  The food, staff and service is above excellent.  I have never been disappointed and we go there often.  Brunch is especially good.  Highly recommend."
5,5,5,5,"My girlfriend and I came in on a busy Saturday night with reservations. My hope was that she would leave with me as my fianc茅e. I told the hostess my plan weeks in advance and she was very quick to accommodate anything I needed. When we arrived, the hostess took us to the best table in the house.  Our waitress鈥 knowledge was unparalleled and I knew we were in good hands.We had the large cheese board as an appetizer which was incredible. Every single sample was delicious and we wished we had a second board! For our main course my girlfriend chose the duck breast, and I went with the strip steak. We鈥檝e traveled extensively but let me tell you, this was one of the best steaks I鈥檝e ever had. The phrase 鈥渕elts in your mouth鈥 comes to mind. The duck was equally astonishing. For desert we shared Pumpkin ice cream. We鈥檙e regular patrons of both Arethusa鈥檚 ice cream shop and coffee shop, and this was the best ice cream we鈥檝e ever had!On top of all the great food we ordered, the chef kept adding complimentary goodies to try. Totally creative, delicious and very bold. We loved it. The service from the host to the food runners, the bussers to the the waitstaff, and the manager was superb. Everyone made their way to our table to converse, to help, and to show warmth and love throughout the evening. I can鈥檛 talk enough about how much it meant.After dinner, I got down on one knee and popped the question. The room filled with maybe 80 people suddenly stood quiet. All that was left were several cute whispers and gasps. She of course said yes and we were accompanied by a round of applause! It was a moment we鈥檒l remember for a lifetime. We chose Arethusa because we knew they鈥檇 be there for us. They completely outdid themselves."
5,5,5,5,Amazing. I will Definately visit again.
5,5,5,4,Amazing food
5,5,5,5,"Top class food , every dish was as good as the last couldn鈥檛 choose which was my favourite. Service was faultless made to feel right at home and not a stone left unturned. A special meal"
5,5,5,5,excellent experience
5,5,5,5,The food is impeccable as is the service and ambiance. It is well worth the time and money.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing friendly service, the best langoustine and tenderloin ever, and great music! Had such a great time with my friends! Can't wait to go back again."
5,5,5,5,A truly great meal
5,5,5,5,"Atera鈥檚 experience is always outstanding, warm and memorable... it鈥檚 what 3 michelin stars should be but even better... by far the best restaurant in NYC"
5,5,5,5,"We spent about 2.5 hours at the 9:30 seating last Saturday night.  Food was amazing -- highly creative cuisine,  absolutely delicious with lots of contrasts in flavor, texture, and temperature.  My wife and I each had our individual favorites, but there were no duds anywhere on the 16-course menu.  Presentations were beautifully composed, and the restaurant operates like a finely tuned machine.  Hard to imagine a better coordinated team.  This is arguably one of the best meals that we have ever had anywhere in the world.  We will definitely try to return next time we are in NYC."
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely amazing experience with, what felt like,  a chef's table dining.Each course unique and different making a favourite different to decide on.High levels of attentive staff pacing the 12 course tasting menu.Not cheap, but much better than  some long standing higher Michelin rated restaurants  and worth the money."
5,5,5,5,The service is sensational and the food is just as incredible.  The combinations of flavors and textures are wonderful.  They use the foods and flavors that are in season to keep everything fresh.  You get personal one on one attention from all the staff that really makes this place stand out and above from all the rest.
5,5,5,5,The food and whole experience was spectacular
5,4,5,3,The entire team led by Matthew and Rachel (along with another gentleman) did a superb job in helping us celebrate our special night out.  We enjoy returning every so often to see what changes have been made to the menu and were sad to hear that the tea ceremony/show was no longer available.  Excellent service and very good food.
5,5,5,5,"Phenomenal dining experience! Loved every dish - really creative cooking.Service was exceptional.They really want to please, and they did!Can't wait to go back."
5,5,5,5,Simply the best 2 stars with 3 stars experience! Perfect
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding best restaurant I鈥檝e been to in a long time! Same food quality if not better than Le Bernardin, Per Se, and definitely Eleven Madison Park. Plus the atmosphere is much less stuffy and more fun. Can鈥檛 wait to go again! Side tip for ladies: staff is hot. 5 stars!"
5,5,5,5,Celebrated my friend鈥檚 birthday and it was the perfect place to do it. Fantastic food and very welcoming crew! It鈥檚 like going to an opera and you get front row seats! You get to watch all the performers up close.
5,5,5,5,"Very well balanced menu, slick service and wonderful presentation. I would recommend it if you can get a reservation."
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding food, artistically presented, expertly served. Every aspect of the experience was perfect. Could not have been happier"
5,5,5,5,"Service, food, wine and presentation all above and beyond."
5,5,5,5,We went there for our anniversary.  They were incredibly accommodating and we had one of the best dinning experiences ever.  The food was impressively high quality and the service was nothing short of perfect.  We鈥檒l definitely be back.
5,5,5,5,Amazing experience!
5,5,5,5,Amazing food. Amazing service. Friendly down to earth staff.
5,5,5,5,Hands down the best restaurant in NYC right now.
5,5,5,5,One of the best restaurants in NYC. Fantastic wine list. Well paced. Flawless service. Outstanding.
5,5,5,5,Dinner was amazing!!! Great service and excellent creative dishes!!! I highly recommend it!! We all loved it!!
5,5,5,5,"Second visit to Atera and we will be back every time in NYC.  The food, service and ambiance is wonderful.  All of the staff is very helpful and attentive."
5,5,5,5,"Dinner here wasn鈥檛 just a meal, it was an experience of a lifetime. From the depth of flavors, different textures, and presentation, every detail was that of art. If you鈥檝e ever been curious to know what poetry would taste like, Chef Ronny can plate that for you lol Big thanks to everyone at Atera for welcoming me and providing me with memories that I will cherish forever."
5,5,5,5,Best of the Best.
5,5,5,5,Everything was perfect!
5,5,5,5,3rd time at Atera and it was great as it always has been. We were celebrating my wife鈥檚 40th birthday and I isn鈥檛 want to take a chance with another restaurant that we hadn鈥檛 been to. Every dish was great and the Uni/egg/truffle dish was spectacular. Little touches like them remembering it was her birthday and the fact that they played the song I requested were also greatly appreciated. Would recommend Atera to anyone looking for a really top-notch dining experience!
5,5,5,5,Ronnie Emborg continues to deliver the goods with an excellent staff. Tried and true deliciousness
5,5,5,5,One of the best meals we have ever had in NYC!
5,5,5,5,Awesome dinner. Thanks
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding, in the top 3 restaurants in NY"
5,5,5,5,Culinary nirvana
5,5,5,5,"Fabulous fabulous food, wonderful service, brilliant wine list.  This restaurant is outstanding in every way, thank you for such a brilliant night.  Wish you were in Australia, would be a regular restaurant for me."
5,5,5,5,"Well deserved two stars, perfect execution, creative and delicious. Just fantastic. The wine list is superb, and not badly priced for NYC, do seek the advice of the sommelier."
5,5,5,5,Excellent Job By the Chef crafting an exciting menu in which each dish progressively was better than the last.Evan did a tremendous Job with the wine and beverage service as well
5,5,5,4,Enjoyed a very inventive and delicious tasting menu dinner at Atera.  The staff all worked together like a well oiled machine.  The service was friendly and unobtrusive and the food was outstanding.
5,5,5,5,"I took my husband here for his birthday. Food and drinks were absolutely amazing! I have a gluten allergy and they were so amazing with it. They gave me a gluten free menu and suggested things to get off my husbands regular menu that could be gluten free. My husband picked a bottle of wine and they couldn鈥檛 find it (not really sure what happened there) but they upgraded the wine and kept it at the original cost. Lastly, we ordered dessert and they still brought a little special treat for his birthday so he got two desserts! It was truly amazing experience and I would definitely recommend if you have some money to spend!"
5,5,5,5,I am from South Africa and this was by far the best steak I have ever experienced. The sommelier was helpful as well.
5,5,5,5,"Food was excellent, service was perfect."
5,5,5,5,Great anniversary dinner! Food was delicious and service was excellent
5,5,5,5,"My colleagues raved about the food, ambience and service for days. Very memorable meal and will be back soon"
5,5,5,5,Great service and the food was outstanding
5,5,5,5,The Wagyu ribeye was absolutely amazing and I always wanted to try it. I was not disappointed with it. However I simply couldn鈥檛 say it was an excellent value because that cost for a steak just simply isn鈥檛 a value.
5,4,5,5,Birthday celebration
4,5,4,4,I have been to Barclay Prime numerous times. However this time our steaks were beyond amazing. Service was great as always. I did notice a few changes on the menu as well as the wines by the glass. I highly recommend for a quick bite in the bar/lounge area or a great sit down dinner date
4,3,5,5,"The service was fantastic. Room and ambiance was excellent too. Unfortunately the food was not at the same level, nor was the value."
5,5,5,5,The ambience from when we first walked in and were seated to the service from Glenn and the food was amazing! Would definitely recommend! It was a surprise celebration and they made the experience for us to be one we will never forget!
5,5,5,5,We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was outstanding; we will definitely be making this restaurant a regular spot for dinner dates and meetings.
5,5,5,5,"Great food, beautifully plated, service was excellent"
4,3,5,4,Beautiful decor and ambiance but food was just okay. Chopped salad was over dressed and over sized. I splurged on the Waygu Filet and it was just ok. Creamed spinach was way too salty. Tater tots tasted just like the ore ida ones. I guess I expected more compared to the chain steakhouses. I would have rated Sullivan鈥檚 and Ruth鈥檚 Chris higher than Barclay.  I do have to give a shout out for the service though. Some kind of fabric made its way into my drink cup and they were very gracious about it.
5,5,5,5,It was excellent from the professionalism of the staff and the excellence of the food.  We had a great time.
5,5,5,5,Amazing quality food. Perfect for that special occasion.
3,5,2,5,Great food & atmosphere. Service didn鈥檛 meet expectations.
5,5,5,5,Melissa was our server and she was excellent and fun.
5,5,5,5,"I've been to some of the best steakhouses in the world Peter Luger, Pappas Bros, Berns, Nusrets, Delfriscos, Sparks and Carnevino. I would say that this boutique steakhouse is at the top of my list!"
4,4,4,5,A very good choice in Philly is you're looking for a steakhouse. Wonderfully relaxing atmosphere with terrific service. I come here when I'm in the area.  I'm usually a Tomahawk rib eye guy thought the done in filet is outstanding.
5,5,5,5,Barclay Prime did not disappoint. The attention to details is only second to the absolutely delicious food you are served. The bread popovers were amazing as always and the filet was done to perfection. Make sure to save room for dessert and get the triple cookie with ice cream. Truly all these things make it my favorite place to dine.
5,5,5,5,"This a great restaurant, but it is too dark. I could not see anything."
5,5,5,5,"The food was delicious and service was outstanding. Nice atmosphere and great music in the background. We got there very late the other night due to a family member in the nearby hospital and we were treated wonderful and they didn鈥檛 rush us or make us feel like we were imposing. It was a wonderful dinner, will be back..."
5,5,5,5,"Barclay Prime was fantastic!  The server was great, food and wine was really good and we were happy to be able to hear each other.  It was a perfect night for celebrating our anniversary!"
5,5,5,5,"From the second we checked in for our reservation to the time we left, each and every staff member was absolutely lovely and attentive. We will definitely be dining here again next time we鈥檙e in Philadelphia. The decor is beautiful. It鈥檚 romantic though a bit noisy, but, the seating is plush and the noise didn鈥檛 bother us at all."
4,2,5,4,The overall steak quality dropped a tad.  I'm hoping this was a one time slip as I loved this restaurant.
5,5,5,5,"The service was excellent from the moment we stepped in the door. From the Hostess, to the bar/lounge server and our dining server.  The food was just as good as everything was cooked to perfection as asked.  I have the Wagyu from Japan (A5) and it did not disappoint at all.  They even brought out a slice of cake for my parents as part of the dessert that read Happy 50th Anniversary, which I had noted on the Open Table reservation when I made it.  I cannot wait until the next time I can revisit!"
5,5,5,4,"Amazing steaks, amazing cocktails, incredible whipped potatoes, the only thing that wasn鈥檛 our style was the lighting. It is just so dark in there! But our experience was lovely"
5,5,5,5,"Went here to celebrate my boyfriend passing the PA Bar Exam. The service was beyond excellent and the steak has ruined steak for us, it was so good. Great place to splurge and celebrate the culmination of his hard work!"
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I went to Barclay Prime for our anniversary and the food and service were amazing.  We had the filet, potato gratin, and brussel sprouts.  Our steaks were perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The sides were great too.  The sommelier made a perfect recommendation.  We highly recommend Barclay Prime!"
5,5,5,5,"Always the best, but not cheap!"
5,5,5,5,"Amazing Steakhouse from Stephen Starr with a great interior, classic steaks and a few surprises thrown in.  The delecata squash special was amazing and the desserts are well worth saving room for.  The steak was well cooked and there was an extensive wine and cocktail menu.  Definitely a great spot in Rittenhosue Square."
5,5,5,5,Delicious and conducive to business discussions
5,5,5,4,Consistently excellent. Never had a bad meal. I love it and I'm not a red meat eater.
5,5,5,5,"We sat in the lounge and loved it. It was quiet and our service was excellent. The wagyu filet was probably the best steak I have ever had in my life. The cocktails were delicious, as well. Thanks again to Pavel for taking such good care of me and my husband on our honeymoon!"
5,5,5,5,"Spectacular service, great cocktails and wonderful food.   Don鈥檛 miss the special cheesesteak!"
5,5,5,5,Amazing as always. Best service of anywhere we have gone. Edward is phenomenal.
3,3,5,3,"Excellent server but the meal itself was very average. And when you are throwing down $300 plus for just myself and my husband I would have expected top notch food. We have eaten at so many excellent restaurants in Philly for a way better price tag. We will not be back. (Also, so dark you could hardly see where you are walking. I am only 30 years old so can't blame that on old eyes )"
3,3,3,4,"Not as good as it used to be. We come from out of town to eat year as it is our favorite restaurant and it has been 2 years since our last visit. My steak was not hot and they did not properly season the steak. Typically my plate is also warm and this time it was cold I think they were waiting on my husbands steak since it was larger and mine was done too quickly. I saw a lot of food being sent back that night. Also, it was our anniversary and it was not acknowledged."
5,5,5,5,Dinner at Barclay Prime was outstanding.  The Waygu cheesesteak is a must have! The entire experience from start to finish was first class.
5,5,5,5,"Fabulous experience! Perfect for a special occasion, the food was best to date at any LA restaurant!"
5,5,5,4,"I live in the Washington DC area, and my son is in Marina del Rey.  This is our 3rd time and the restaurant and it never disappoints.   Food is just great.  Love the red beet pappardelle, and the seafood was very good.  Scallop apple is to die for.  I rarely write review and I am a frequent Open Table VIP.  Enough said.  This is Barrique Venice is so worth it."
5,5,5,5,"The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all perfect for our dinner at Barrique. It is always a good sign when a good number of people working in an Italian restaurant are actually italian. Despite being pricey, the food is delicious and is more than your basic bowl of pasta. The beet pasta was beautiful and delicious. The richness was balanced and made the meal feel decadent. We also had the pasta with rabbit ragu. This was actually mine and my husbands favorite."
5,5,5,5,Any occasion is perfect at Barrique
5,3,5,5,I am not sure what to rate them? Appetizer brilliant. Main dish just horrible. I think this a five star restaurant that made an error with the main. We will go back and order the same. I鈥檒l reserve final judgment until then.
5,5,5,5,"This was our second experience at Barrique Venice. Both were exceptional! Barrique is definitely shaping up to be our favorite neighborhood restaurant!  The service was very gracious and the food outstanding. It鈥檚 also a lovely, quaint space.   I love the scallop appetizer. My husband had the prosciutto and burrata appetizer. It was huge, gorgeous and could have been an entree.   My beet pasta with Quail Ragu was excellent but the surprise hit of the evening was he smoked duck breast on carmelized onions.  We can鈥檛 wait to try to duplicate it at home."
5,5,5,5,"The food is so rich, I can't describe it. It's certainly the best Italian restaurant I've ever been!"
5,5,5,5,Absolutely love the atmosphere.  the food is amazing.  the service is extraordinary.  i would celebrate any occasion here always
5,5,5,5,"Every dish was more incredible and delicious then the next. Just listen to your server and go with it. You will be amazed. The octopus, the homemade pastas, the fillet, the atmosphere, the service and staff absolutely divine!!! Such a charming gem of a restaurant. Can鈥檛 wait to go back!"
4,4,5,4,Lovely evening. Excellent food and service.
5,5,5,5,"On honeymoon with my husband and made late booking for here after watching the sunset at a local roof bar. The service was friendly, warm and informative. Food was excellent- even portion size was more European than American so don鈥檛 expect to take away leftovers. Dessert was amazing too. Only negative was white wine choice was less than 15 but had 3.5 pages for red wine (50+) - definitely worth a visit"
5,5,5,5,"Very nice place for a date. My only issue is the lack of AC on the second floor. It was a warm 鈥淪anta Ana Winds鈥 night, and the restaurant does not have AC. We sat on the second floor inside. Next time under the same conditions ask for one of the tables outside on the deck/patio. Food was outstanding, service was wonderful and the selection great."
5,5,5,5,"One of the best, if not the best, Italian dinners I鈥檝e ever had. Everything was a 10/10."
4,5,4,4,"Great atmosphere. Friendly, informative staff.The owner was great and engaged with the patrons.The food and the wine choices were fabulous. Everything from the caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes to the to the pink vodka fettuccine special.A very enjoyable evening."
5,5,5,5,"Between the ambiance, food, and service, I couldn鈥檛 imagine a better experience. First impressions are always the lasting ones and this restaurant made a strong one as you drive down Main Street looking for the restaurant (built in a house) that鈥檚 nestled between Venice鈥檚 apartments and houses. The lighting and fixtures simply just fit the style of food and familial atmosphere . Authentic pasta dishes with perfect portions. Servers were very accommodating and immediately (without) question righted a mistaken order.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and others who鈥檇 be willing to listen."
5,5,5,4,"We loved this place. The food is unique, and exquisite. It feels like there is a lot of skill and Love put into these dishes. Wine selection is exceptional, but expensive. Treat yourself."
5,5,5,5,This was my second visit to this excellent restaurant. The fresh pasta is truly delicious.
5,5,5,5,"Beautiful spot with amazing and unique food. We had a caprese starter and quail ragu beet pasta and black truffle ravioli. Incredible service and delicious red wine. Best part is it is an intimate setting where you can hear who you鈥檙e sitting across from still. Charming, will return!"
5,5,5,5,"In town for our Anniversary and we were not disappointed for our first night out. Michael, our waiter, was outstanding and the food was delicious."
5,5,5,5,"Inventive, interesting food that celebrates Italian cuisine in a new way."
5,5,4,5,Amazing food and ambiance. 10/10
5,5,5,5,"Excellent fresh pasta, fantastic wine selection, and great service! I love this place and I definitely recommend!"
5,5,5,5,"This was our second visit to Barrique Venice. Each time the food has been outstanding, the service warm and attentive and that atmosphere conducive to having adult conversation without shouting. The indoor dining space is intimate. My only hesitation in ""highly recommending"" the restaurant is that others will catch on and it will become more difficult to book."
5,3,5,5,"Outside on balcony on a warm summer night was ideal. Not noisy or hot (which it seemed to be inside). Alessandro took exceptional care of us - he gave us great, honest advice - ""don't get the duck with the white fish because they won't work together."" He was the highlight of our evening. I took my friend for her birthday and we were there for over 3 hours. Never felt rushed, only welcomed like we were family. The food was good but it wasn't blow-your-mind amazing. The scallops and grilled octopus were lovely but the John Dory (a special) was okay but portion was modest. The chef didn't overwhelm it with garlic (thank goodness) but it was just ... unremarkable. I will go back but make a different entree choice and hope to find something that wows me.  It is a gem of a restaurant - just don't find a place like this in West LA. In a 1905 building it will charm you. If only the food was as amazing as the staff and space."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely love this place . So romantic with great food and service.
5,5,5,5,"Such amazing service, atmosphere, and food. Every time I go I鈥檓 always amazed at how good the food is."
2,1,5,4,"Great ambiance and service, but it really stops there. Based on the reviews, I was ecstatic to go to Barrique Venice. However, every single thing we ordered was extremely bland. When the ahi tuna was bland, I said to myself, ""wait until the halibut."" Unfortunately, the halibut was even less flavorful. I thought I may be giving it a hard time, until my date spoke up and said that hers was equally underwhelming. I wanted to love it based on the lighting, and how quiet/ romantic it was, but I won't be returning anytime soon. I should note that the service was rock solid - waiters are extremely energetic, knowledgeable, and passionate about what they do. Very disappointing"
5,5,5,3,Birthday Dinner
5,5,5,5,"amazing food, very nice ambiance, great service. you will truly enjoy your meal here."
2,2,2,3,"The waiter messed up my order, then blamed me for it... Didn't feel good. Over cooked steak..."
5,5,5,5,"Such a lovely and fun restaurant.  The scallops were just delicious, all the pastas we tried were great, and the dessert with 3 types of chocolate mousse was perfect.  Good wine selections and excellent service.  We'll be back."
5,5,5,5,Great group dinner for 50th bday. Took great care of us. Love this place!
4,5,4,5,"Amazing restaurant! Food was perfectly prepared and flavorful. We shared the caprese salad, pasta, and a filet mignon. My only complaint was lack of non alcoholic options."
5,5,5,5,Most romantic restaurant in La!! Loved it
5,5,5,5,"Beautiful venue, incredible food and service, great location, definitely too expensive to be coming to nightly but that makes each experience all the more special and worth it!"
5,5,5,5,Outstanding food. Outstanding service. Romantic ambiance. Natalia at host stand was A+++ as were all the Italian servers.
5,5,5,5,Very good!
5,5,5,5,"Service was on point ,food was well done, ambience was incredible ,my date was hot"
3,4,4,2,"Cramped space. Too many tables jammed into a tiny space. So uncomfortable and noisy. Food was good, but we were not wowed. Service was good. Good wine list. Too expensive for the experience."
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic food and wonderful service for a birthday dinner! We had grilled peach appetizer with all the flavor of summer on a plate. Tender roast duck breast with tasty carmelized onions, perfectly seared filet mignon, and complemented both with a side of Paccheri Alla Norma. Terrific food. Great service. Nice wine list that is edited to compliment the meals. Dessert disappeared so fast, it was that good. We will be back."
5,5,5,5,"Order the bone in ribeye, it's the reason you came, it's amazing.Also, oysters are great and you cannot lose with the sides"
5,5,5,5,Bavette鈥檚 is by far my favorite restaurant.  We split oysters and shrimp which was very good.  Smoked salmon Caesar salad which was fabulous. Oh....-and the warm bread with amazing crust was divine.  Salmon dish slightly spiced was delicious. Loaded baked potato with diced bacon very tasty. Son in law had a steak that was very good and my daughter had chicken.  Everything was delicious.
5,5,5,5,Food lived up to the hype!!! But the plate that stole the show was the Brussel Sprouts!!! Never in my wildest dreams did I expect them to be this good! Highly recommend them!!
5,5,5,5,Amazing steakhouse in Chicago! Great for a date night or birthday dinner! Service was excellent and food was outstanding!
4,5,3,5,I had been looking forward to my reservations for months.  It was a late night reservation due to availability.  We ordered an appetizer that was forgotten about until we reminded our server.  It was brought out moments before our entr茅e.  This put a damper on a highly anticipated date night for my husband's birthday.  The appetizer was later comped and service was good up until we had to flag down our server to get our dessert wrapped up to go.  Food was good but the service will not have me returning.  There are far better restaurants with top notch service for the price.
5,5,5,5,Best restaurant in the city consistently top notch
5,5,5,5,"Everything was great, service, food, ambiance. We had to book our reservation well in advance, but it lived up to the wait. Would recommend, and would go again."
5,5,4,5,"Ambiance and food  were outstanding. Possibly the best steak dinner my wife and I have ever had.  We both had the filet . Cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and I called ahead for reservations and table on the main floor. Great table but our server never mentioned the occasion to my wife. Would highly recommend for outstanding food,  terrific surroundings and memorable night."
2,4,1,5,Slow service and did not honor reservation time
5,5,4,5,Best steakhouse in the city. And the seafood is amazing as well.
5,5,5,5,The filet mignon was cooked to perfection .  The service from Klause was excellent. We highly recommend this romantic and fantastic place.
5,5,5,5,Best steak in Chicago.  Would definitely recommend to anyone!
4,5,3,4,"We were sat at a table towards the door last night. Very drafty when the door opened. Disappointing they did not do more to keep the doors from being open at same time.Food was very good. I thought the service was just average. Was expecting exceptional experience, was just pretty good"
5,5,5,5,"Our waiter Ben was great, we didn鈥檛 feel rushed. We sat downstairs in a booth and the music and atmosphere was nice . The bottle of wine we had paired beautifully with our steak ."
5,5,5,5,The best!!
4,4,4,5,"Very enjoyable place to visit, the burger is a must!"
5,5,5,5,"One of the best steaks in Chicago! Try bone marrow and ribeye, they are the must."
2,2,5,4,Steak had to be sent back twice and on the third time it was overcooked and tasted terrible. Huge disappointment but the waiter was very good and they were nice enough to remove my steak from the bill. Sides and apps were delicious. Very very dark restaurant.
5,5,5,5,"I try and get to Bavettes as often as possible - amazing place.  Had difficulty with my prior visit as I had an 8:00 PM reservation (Downstairs - Parlor) and they seated me at 9:20 PM so I was very upset.  This reservation would be my last if that happened again but they were perfect in everyway on this visit.  We sat downstairs (preferred space), waiter was awesome and the food is always the star here.  Bavette's has the best atmosphere in the city - we will be back!"
4,5,3,4,"Went to celebrate my daughter鈥檚 birthday- the hostess acknowledged that and then no one after that mentioned her birthday. Somewhat of a bummer as several tables near us were served desserts with sparklers.  We were lucky that Erik finally made it back to our table to get a dessert order let alone send sparklers. Laid back is one thing but Erik takes it to an art form. Food was wonderful, back staff was on the ball, Erik seemed not to care"
4,4,5,4,"Very good food, but not exceptional within this price range.  Terrific, friendly and timely service.  Good wine selection at reasonable prices.  Background music is too loud and interferes with conversation."
3,3,2,4,"Waiting for a reservation without knowing how long the table is going to be, being told that it's 2mins which turns into 10mins is frustrating. Multiple times they got the order wrong and I've cooked better $70 Ribeyes at home"
4,4,5,4,"Waited 40 minutes to be sat, and then were sat in the basement"
4,4,3,5,"Food was good and service was very friendly but timing of food delivery was uneven. We ordered three steaks, all medium...one came out medium, another medium-well and a third well-done. All top quality beef but not as ordered. Sides large and good. We had a booth, which was great."
5,5,5,5,The food was great and we enjoyed the atmosphere and music!
5,5,5,5,Food was excellent service and waiting time was right on schedule . Staff did a great job
5,5,5,5,"Took me several months to get a reservation but it was worth it. My wife and I went with my brother and his wife. For appetizers we ordered the steak tartare, shrimp cocktail and half dozen oysters. All were great. For steaks the bone in ribeye and the petite fillet. They were cooked perfectly with great flavor. For sides, the sweet potatoes, crab stuffed avocado salad, truffle mac and cheese and elote style corn. For me the elote style corn was the best but all were good. As for the wine, I highly recommend the Colombo Apertura Pinot Noir. One of the best wines I have had in a long time. No dessert unfortunately but if you see the amount of food we ordered you will understand why we passed.The ambiance of the place was also very cool. The music was great and the noise level was a little high but sitting in the booth we didn't have much difficulty hearing. There is a great bar area both upstairs and down. Only complaint is the restroom situation. They are single restrooms and there was at least one to two waiting in line. Not a big deal.Overall an excellent meal and great scene. Would love to go back so I better get to work trying to secure another reservation. People did walk in without a reservation and I overheard them being told hour thirty to an hour forty-five. Not that unusual for a high-end restaurant downtown but I prefer a reservation."
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and great service.  Definitely worth a trip to Bavette if you are going through Chicago.  YUM!!
5,5,5,5,It was fabulous !!!! We love Bavettes ...It is our most favorite restaurant ever !!
4,5,2,4,Well executed food but the service left quite a bit to be desired.
5,5,5,5,Amazing service and food was outstanding.
4,4,4,5,"Went to Bavette's for a date night and the food was really good! Only disappointment was the length of time we were there. We ended up being there for 3.5 hours due to the wait time on our steaks. Also, I ordered a bone-in filet cooked medium+ and it was pretty well-done except close to the bone. Still very flavorful though!"
5,5,5,5,We were there for my boyfriends surprise 30th! The staff went above and beyond to make this special surprise perfect!
5,5,4,5,"The first time I came to Bavette's we only had appetizers and side dishes--and it was amazing. I wanted to come back and get to experience one of the best steaks in Chicago. It definitely lived up to the hype and as always, the sides (specifically the wedge salad with their famous bacon and the garlic mashed potatoes) were fantastic as well. The ambiance makes you feel like you've stepped into a classic Chicago speakeasy, especially in the basement and the service was on point. Great spot to celebrate a special occasion."
4,4,4,3,"Bavettes came highly recommended. First of all, it is quite dark in the dining room. The rest rooms are old and small. The bar area has a rather nice ambiance. There is an additional dining room in the ""dungeon"" which provides less noise and more privacy. The food is pricey and I would suffice it to say that you do not necessarily get your money's worth. The portions are relatively small. The filet mignon and lamb chops were average. However, the crab was excellent! The service is attentive. I think there are many other superior options for steaks, chops and seafood in the area.  We will not be returning to Bavettes anytime soon."
5,5,5,4,Loved the food! Came out very fast. Service was amazing. Food was hot and seasoned just right. Will be back!
5,5,4,5,So good! Their Mac and cheese with bacon 馃い
5,5,5,5,Amazing! Great experience!
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful anniversary dinner.  Impeccable service. Phenomenal food.  My favorite restaurant in Chicago,"
5,5,5,5,My wife and I had an excellent time.  The ambiance was amazing!  The music playing was sultry and seductive.  The food was great!!!! The service was outstanding!!!! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!!! Perfect date night restaurant!!!
5,5,5,5,It was really impressive dining and we were most pleased with service.  It鈥檚 worth a visit at least once.
5,5,5,5,Took my wife for her birthday. We had an amazing meal and experienced amazing service.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing experience, went for a birthday dinner and had an amazing time."
5,5,5,5,Outstanding service. Sumptuous dishes. Great wine pairing.
5,5,5,5,The wife鈥檚 birthday dinner was amazing. We showed up about 30 minutes early. Instead of making us wait they sat  us right away. The service was top notch.  Every dish brought  out was explained in detail by the server. Drink too. Food  was excellent.  Every bite had so much flavor.  3 hrs of tickling our tastes buds.
5,5,5,5,Impeccable service and foot from start to finish.  We鈥檒l be back!
5,5,5,5,One of the best culinary experiences! Will definitely come back
4,5,5,4,"Dishes are amazing. Asian flavors just right. Price on the high side, though, even comparing with other three-michelin-star restaurants in the US or Europe."
5,5,5,4,"Food: Simply outstanding, starting off with a parade of luxurious small bites and segueing into the coursed meals each meticulously created and presented with their complex flavors and textures which are best experienced and impossible to describe.Service: Nearly flawless. Our main waitress was perfect and professional. Dishes came a bit poorly timed where we were not finished with one plate before the next arrived.  Different staff brought out and explained dishes and there was inconsistency between the level of skill of one of them.Ambiance: For a 3-star Michelin restaurant, I felt tables were a bit too close and we unfortunately sat next to a large party which made it difficult to listen to one of the dishes being explained to us by the waitstaff.Overall: Impeccable food and culinary experience. Great professional staff. Flaws were timing of dishes and ambient noise level which for a 3-star restaurant should be fixed."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful tasting experience.
3,3,4,3,Was really excited but disappointed by most dishes.
5,5,5,4,Exceeded all expectations.
5,5,5,4,Unique.  Unfamiliar territory.
5,5,5,5,Awesome experience perfect
5,5,5,5,"Best restaurant we have ever been to, top to bottom. We have been fortunate to have been to all 8 3-star restaurants in the Bay Area (including Saison when it still had it's 3rd star). Benu tops them all in terms of consistently stunning preparation and taste balance. No weaknesses. And yet not over the top and didn't stuff us as some others have done. Super impressed."
5,5,5,5,Exquisite!!
5,5,4,4,Food is outstanding as always
5,5,5,5,"This was truly a special, world class experience."
5,5,5,4,"A spectacular tasting meal of many unusual and delicious Asian dishes. Highlights included lobster coral xiao long bao (dumplings infused with lobster soup), summer chrysanthemum tofu soup, beef tongue with radish, pear kimchi and other fixings and a wonderful milk pudding that was savoury, smoky and sweet. Plus the service was impeccable."
5,5,5,5,The food is gorgeous! And each course looks like a piece of art. They prepare special gift for us because we are celebrating our marriage.
5,5,5,5,"Great food, amazing staff and a wonderful experience all in all. Thanks for hosting our anniversary dinner."
4,4,5,3,"Benu had been on my must-dine list for quite some time. My visit there was for a weeknight dinner and the experience was up and down. While certainly unique and in many ways deserving of its 3 Michelin stars, it also left me puzzled at the ambience and seeming aloofness of the Team The food, was expertly prepared and presented and each dish was well conceived and executed. A few favorites were the 鈥渟picy鈥 caviar set, the acorn / truffle / Iberico pancake and the roasted quail.The plating all night was beautiful, but that quail dish was one one the most beautiful presentations I have ever we seen. Bravo.The room is austere and to use a word? Cold. Not in the temperature sense, but in the lack of spirit and engagement. It land in stark contrast to a similar type of restaurant like Saison- where the warmth and conviviality add greatly to the meal and experience. Sadly this is not the case at Benu and what would keep me from recommending it over say, SingleThread or The Inn at Meadowood.IsBenu worth it? I would still say it is. Are there better experiences to be had at No Cal 3-star restaurants? Unequivocally yes. Go and try it for yourself - but take some guests with a smile and energy - you鈥檒l be glad that you did."
5,5,5,5,Best meal I鈥檝e ever had.
5,5,5,4,Chef Corey Lee鈥檚 marvellous reinterpretation of the modern Korean cuisine.
5,5,5,5,Truly outstanding. Fully deserves the reputation
5,5,5,4,Very good birthday experience at Benu. Staffs were providing fantastic service. Recommend in 3 star restaurants options!
5,5,5,5,"This was an incredible experience all around!  Definitely recommend the beverage pairing for a truly unique and indulgent accompaniment.  Worth the plane ride, worth the price."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely exquisite. Such an impressive experience.
5,5,5,5,"Eaten all over the world, including French Laundry & this is the best!!!"
5,5,5,4,"Very creative and consistently excellent food . Joyous , full of energy and intelligent service"

5,5,5,5,Knowlwdgeable staff on all that was served. Highly recommend sommilier wine pairing with Yoon.Memorable tastes and wonderful experience!!
4,5,3,3,Services and noisy could be improved.
5,5,5,5,We were in our engagement celebration and staff and food were just excellent
5,5,4,3,"Excellent tasting menu.  Very inventive bites start the meal.  The menu simply indicates bites to start the meal but they just keep coming.  1,000 year old quail egg was worth the trip alone.  Veal short rib and quail were both very good.  Service is efficient.  Valet parking really nice added touch.  Car was ready in the courtyard as we left."
5,5,5,5,The staff at Benu made the overall experience amazing. The food was on point. Every bite was meaningful.
5,5,5,5,I went to five $300 plus meals in the last few weeks and it Was the number one by a long long lead
3,3,5,3,"Not a three star experience. The food is fine, starting out with some interesting small bites that give way to some surprisingly uninspired mains. One dish was presented with a number of condiments, and after eating everything, the rest of the dish was presented. Had we known there was a Part 2, we could have planned better. Few explanations were given about what order to eat things in, or with what sauces or sides. The surroundings are nice, but nothing special. For more than $1000 for two (with drinks) one expects much more. The service was generally good, even though dishes were whisked away before you even had a chance to digest (metaphorically) what you had just eaten. Some plates were cleared while the other diner was still eating, something that should never happen in a restaurant of this supposed caliber. The whole experience was a little weird, and not even close to our expectations."
5,5,5,5,"My girlfriend and I visited Benu for her birthday, and we had an exceptional experience. The menu was well thought out, and each item was unique, flavorful, and just enough. The portions are small allowing you to taste enough to be satisfied, but not too full to continue.Throughout the meal I literally had goosebumps from the unique flavors I experienced. My eyes actually watered while eating the Sea Urchin.The staff was also knowledgeable, friendly, and extremely attentive. My water cup was never less than half full. Our napkins were always neatly folded if we went outside or to the bathroom. At one point, I wiped some sauce that had spilled onto the table, and within seconds I was greeted with a fresh napkin."
5,5,4,5,On par with Quince. Pretty fantastic experience. Quince鈥檚 service was more personal.
5,5,5,5,"Another spectacular meal at Bida Manda.  It鈥檚 hard to find enough superlatives to describe the food, in particular, and the friendly service and cozy, rustic Asian decor add to the experience.  Highly recommended."
5,5,5,5,"Never disappoints. Fantastic food, service, drinks... servers are outstanding. One of my favorites in Raleigh."
4,4,5,4,"Our waitress Sophia was excellent and very friendly. It was my sister鈥檚 birthday so we loved the way they bring a free dessert tray with 3 small shareable desserts, they even brought one for my 93 year old mother whose birthday is in January! We had a 1:30pm lunch reservation (they closed for lunch at 2:00pm) and they didn鈥檛 rush us at all to finish and continued to wait on us. Very enjoyable will definitely return!"
5,5,5,5,Great experience as usual! Christina is excellent!
5,5,5,5,"Jordan's wine select for the Thursday, November 7, 2019 was questionable. Blend from Portugal  We kept hoping it would get better during the meal.  It did not.  I have faith his judgment is normally very fine but on this one wine... this one time... not so much."
5,5,5,5,"Amazing. Our server was tremendous. Get the crispy rice lettuce wraps, pork belly soup, and lemongrass and dill sausage."
5,5,5,5,Always a great dinner and service is stellar!
5,5,5,5,Wonderful food and service.   A favorite of my family.
5,5,4,5,Excellent food. Highly recommend the pho and the curry!
5,5,5,5,Appetizers were amazing! Crispy rice and spring rolls! Very cool ambience!
4,4,5,4,"That was a very nice experience! We loved the place, service and food. The crispy rice lettuce wrap is fantastic!!!"
5,5,5,5,The food and atmosphere was amazing! Also the staff was very friendly and helpful. I鈥檓 definitely going back.
5,5,5,5,Bida Manda was delicious and we will definitely be back! The lemongrass Sausage was amazing and the palette cleanser juice so tasty!
5,5,5,5,Amazing night at Bida Manda. Our server was incredibly friendly but was very respectful of our space and didn't bother us too much. He also made an effort to congratulate the Med School student (it was a special dinner for him) and remembered all of our names. Also the meal was delicious!!! This restaurant has a great back story that I recommend looking it up before you come.
5,5,5,5,"Loved our dinner at Bida Manda! We had the crispy rice lettuce wraps, the papaya salad with flatiron steak, and the crispy pork belly soup. Service was excellent!"
5,5,5,5,Highly recommend! Great service and all the food was delicious
3,3,2,4,Service was slow. Food was bland
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food and service. A little pricey, but most people would say it's worth it."
5,5,5,5,"I love the customer service ALONE!! This is my second time and both times I was treated with LOTS of attention even with it being busy. As for the FOOD!! Everything was DEVINE, I will be back hopefully with friends if not THEIR LOST!!"
5,5,5,5,Absolutely great service and the food cannot be better!
5,5,5,5,"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  Service was so great, she was helpful and super friendly and let us just hang and enjoy our meal.  The food was OUTSTANDING!  Everything we had was just off the charts good!  I can't wait to go back."
2,2,2,4,My food was great but my friends papaya salad was way off. Waitress did not have her act together. She was very nice but silverware and water had to be requested a few times. Our orders did not hit the table at the same time and  the bill was not split correctly. I鈥檓 assuming it was an off night because I usually love this restaurant.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing service, food and atmosphere. True Raleigh gem!"
5,5,5,5,"Always friendly, efficient service and wonderful, interesting food. It's my wife's choice every year for her birthday, and their computer records automatically seat us at our favorite table. She gets a free little dessert and no waiters singing -- just what she wants!"
5,5,5,5,We typically come here to celebrate our birthdays and always have a great experience.  The food is delicious - our favorites are the chicken or pumpkin curry and crispy pork belly soup.  We always typically also get the spring rolls (either pork or vegetable) and are never disappointed.  The service is always exceptional as well.
5,5,5,5,"As always, we had an outstanding experience that could only be topped by us owning the restaurant."
5,5,4,5,"We had a lovely evening at Bida Manda; the food was delicious, service was prompt, the only downside that our waiter rushed us a bit and could have been more attentive considering the circumstances. The crispy pork belly soup was impeccable and the salad was the best I've had! Telling all our friends and family about this wonderful experience!"
5,5,5,5,"We had an amazing late dinner with some amazing drinks. The staff was super friendly. I had the Green Papaya Salad with fried trout. I had the spiciest heat level, and it was fantastic but be ready for some intense heat. My sister had the Chicken Curry and it was one of the best I have ever tasted. Bida Manda is a must visit if you are looking for a fantastic meal in the Raleigh area."
5,5,5,5,We had such a fantastic experience. The spring rolls to start off were unbelievable. From there I got the stir fry which was fantastic. The mood was perfect and we had a great time. Our server was so enjoyable to work with!
5,5,5,5,"Our waiter,Brill was awesome. We used him to help us navigated the menu. The stuffed Anaheim peppers with house made sausage was very tasty and medium heat so perfect they came with a tomato mixture so so good.The pork belly soup was a great curry soup with noodles and all kinds if goodies. It was my favorite.The papaya salad with duck was excellent, very different and fun. It was a bit spicy for me but my husband really liked it. Our drinks were fun and very good. I give this place a Excellent score and a must to try."
5,5,5,5,"My partner and I went to celebrate our anniversary. We denoted this on our reservation, and the host also asked if we were celebrating anything special. This was a lovely touch because, as a result, we received a complimentary appetizer as well as bubbles with our dessert! The sea bass mok, pork belly soup, and green papaya salad with grilled pork neck were all outstanding! I will be dreaming about the soup and sea bass for weeks."
5,5,5,5,The food was just fantastic. The waitress was very kind and nice. The restaurant atmosphere was enjoyable.
5,5,5,4,"Food quality was amazing!  Price was as anticipated, serving size was moderate."
5,5,5,5,"Bida Manda continues to be a favorite. Needed a special place to take an out of town friend for a special birthday lunch -Bida was spot on and our friend really enjoyed the atmosphere & food. Typically a dinner place for us, but our visit made me realize it needs to be a regular lunch stop too! The energy was good and the noise level was very tolerable. Special bonus was Ashley Christiansen, Raleigh鈥檚 world renowned chef at the neighboring table. Delicious appetizers (spring rolls) and everyone enjoyed and shared their entrees. No room for dessert and now, I鈥檓 going to enjoy my leftovers for lunch!"
5,5,5,5,"Bida Manda is our new favorite spot in Raleigh. The food is beyond amazing, the cocktails are lovely and the service is top notch!"
3,3,4,5,"Very pretty restaurant. Drinks were nice. The food was fine but definitely not worth the price. Server seemed to be anxious for me to put in my entree order, came back 3 times before the appetizers even came out. Won't be going back."
5,5,5,4,"We were traveling to the area and heard about this place from a local resident. It exceeded our expectations, we really enjoyed our dining experience. Thank you!"
4,4,3,5,"This place has absolutely gorgeous decor, and it creates a wonderful ambiance. The food was good, but did not live up to the hype. I think we might have just ordered the wrong thing, because everyone else鈥檚 food around us looked incredible. Our server was good, not an outstanding experience, but he got the job done. Overall a good experience!!"
5,5,5,5,Always consistently fabulous in all areas. Our go to for a nice night out to celebrate anything!
4,5,4,5,"My husband and I just moved to Raleigh and were told we had to try Bida Manda- and I now would highly recommend it! The waitress forgot our second order of drinks but otherwise provided some amazing recommendations and was very attentive. We got the lettuce wraps as an appetizer, and split the pork belly soup and the green papaya salad- we were stuffed and took leftovers home. The pork belly soup was phenomenal and I would most definitely get it again!"
5,5,5,5,It is always amazing. They continue to call you by your name the whole night. Great food and service!
5,5,5,5,"I love the relaxed feel of this place 鈥 like a comfortable dining room in friends home. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The aged bone-in Rib Eye was terrific. Everyone loved the shared side dishes. Service was well-timed and friendly, and wines were affordable."""
3,3,4,4,"Overall the place was not bad in certain aspects. The service was good, responsive. The steaks were dry. The broccoli was saut茅ed in butter but wasn鈥檛 to die for. For the cost that I paid, I will not be going back to Bones."
5,5,5,5,"Bones is a must if you are a lover of a juicy, tender, perfectly seasoned steak. The drinks were to par and the atmosphere set the tone for an amazing night for my hubby's birthday. We will definitely be back for more."
5,5,5,5,Everything was amazing. They encouraged us to take our time and enjoy. We weren鈥檛 rushed. It was a delightful experience.
5,5,5,5,"It was an absolute amazing experience. It was my boyfriends birthday and they gave him a very personal experience- happy birthday on the table, private room, and even a slice of cake! I was very blown away by the service and the attentiveness to our needs. I will definitely be bringing my luxury clients to Bones for a reliable amazing dining experience. Thank you so much."
5,5,4,5,"As always, Bones delivers. Reliability, attention to detail, quality food prepared to please. It is a singular bastion in a world of sad sameness. Truly a great place."
5,5,5,5,Bones is the best!!!
5,5,5,5,Benjamin was fantastic - very attentive and courteous!!
5,5,5,5,Ken is the best!
5,5,5,5,The best restaurant in Atlanta.
5,5,5,5,Great food and service. Bones is a 鈥渕ust鈥 anytime I am in Atlanta.
4,4,5,5,"Split the dry aged rib eye this time and while it was a good steak, it didn't seem to match up with prior experiences at Bones or the price for it. Also the mushrooms were kind of blah for a side. Had a very reasonable and drinkable bottle of cab for $40 and didn't need to spend the $8000 on the Screaming Eagle. Onion soup was cheesy as ever and my wife salad was also excellent."
5,5,5,5,We can鈥檛 say enough great things about this restaurant!  Bone鈥檚 is first class all the way.   The food is outstanding and every staff member including the bartender told my husband happy birthday. Our table was decorated and we were treated like royalty the entire time. I really appreciate the staff making my husbands 50th birthday amazing!
5,5,5,5,This was our first visit to Bones.  The food and service were outstanding.  The ambiance was great.  We will be back!

5,5,5,5,Excellent food and service. We will definitely be back.
5,5,5,5,Bones was easily the best steakhouse I've been to in a long time.  The service and food left us amazed!  Highly recommend!
5,5,5,4,The food and service are always fabulous. We enjoy coming for special occasions and when we want a good steak!
5,4,5,5,best service I have had at any fine steak house.!!!
5,5,5,5,"As always, the service is the very best and the food is amazing. We love going to Bones for special occasions and any time we want to spoil ourselves."
5,5,5,5,"My favorite restaurant in Atlanta! Outstanding food and service. Ask to sit in the wine gallery if you have a party of 4 or less; quieter, more intimate location for dinner."
5,5,5,5,"Great dining experience, if you travel to Atlanta, Bones should be one of the restaurants you choose to eat."
5,5,5,5,It was great! My younger sister鈥檚 favorite!
5,5,5,5,This is the BEST place for lunch in Atlanta!!Best food and best service by the Best Bartenders Thos and Robert!!We hold the French Onion Soup as the standard that we compare any. It is fabulous. Burger is awesome!Don鈥檛 bother with anywhere else!Run to Bones for lunch and sit at the Bar.Thank you all!!!!!
5,5,5,5,What a fabulous lunch! We can't wait to come back!
5,5,5,5,We had a great time! The food was excellent and Derek was an amazing waiter!
5,5,5,5,"An Atlanta must ! Fabulous service, fantastic food , refined and elegant"
5,5,5,4,Wife Birthday
5,5,5,5,"Bones has been voted the best steak house in Atlanta because of their amazing food and great service.  My family loves to go and eat here for special occasions and also just because the food is amazing.  Make sure to try the Mac and Cheese, Truffle Mash potatoes and also the hash brown.  Everything on the menu is amazing and you will not be disappointed."
5,5,5,5,"We really enjoy dining at Bones.  The food is wonderful, and the service is always outstanding.  Thanks for a great evening!"
5,5,5,5,I wish I knew our waiters name he was the best!  Food and atmosphere also very good and excellent wine selection.
4,5,5,4,The food was excellent. We had jumbo shrimp cocktail and filets with lobster tails. The corn pudding is the side to get. Then mile high pie which is amazing!! Servers and assistants are on top of things. Be sure to get a reservation as they have the regulars and a steady crowd.
3,3,3,3,steak was cold and to raw asked for medium i would not go back
5,5,5,5,Overall great job! Will go back next time I鈥檓 in Atlanta for sure!
5,5,5,5,"The experience was wonderful, from the maitre de's personal attention, immediate service, the food presentation and quality, then dessert was awesome!Very expensive and worth it...would like to go more often!"
5,5,5,5,Always a great experience when you dine at Bones!
5,5,5,5,Outstanding from beginning to end. The service was incredible and the food even better. The tuna pizza and crispy rice were sooo yummy! Can not wait to go back.
5,5,3,5,Consistently great.
5,5,5,5,This was an unbeatable dinner. The truffle add on to the Food was spectacular
5,5,5,5,We鈥檙e from Florida and this is our favorite restaurant so it鈥檚 a MUST when we are here!
4,3,3,2,"much much much too noisy service too fast and pushy no class ,but good food"
3,4,2,2,"Food was good. Quality of sushi was about the same we get back home in Atlanta. I expected more in NYC. Service was inattentive. Noise level was almost unbearable. The bar area and hostess stand area were crowded beyond what a code violation would be. The noise level at our table kept us from talking comfortably. More than one table of loud,drunk (and obviously clueless to their surroundings) women"
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, service and surprising value with good portions.  Outstanding creativity and flavors.  Among the best Omakase selections I have ever had.  Fantastic."
5,5,5,4,Nice experience with good food and New York vibes!
4,5,5,3,"We had the five course tasting menu, and everything was spectacular. We can鈥檛 wait to go back, but we鈥檒l be booking as early a reservation as possible. By the time we got to our final course & dessert it was so loud we couldn鈥檛 hear each other across the table."
4,5,3,4,6 pm reservation because we had a 7:30 show and getting seated at 6:20 DOES NOT CUT IT
1,1,2,2,Disappointing quality. Chicken quite dry with bitter sauce. Fish also dry and chewy with minimal flavor.Waitress did not follow-up
5,5,5,5,It was blessed.
5,5,5,5,Great food and service
5,5,5,5,My family and I frequently come to this wonderful restaurant. The food is impeccable and the service is top notch. I throughly enjoyed our waitress tonight. Very accommodating and nice. I hope to return in the near future.
5,5,5,4,"A great dining and social experience every time I visit.  Friendly, welcoming team, with tasty bites.  Looking forward to going back soon!"
5,5,5,5,"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC! Great service, ambiance, cocktails and food. Would recommend the Smoking Mule cocktail, the Tuna Eye Tarts appetizer, Crispy Tuna Rice, Chilean Sea Bass Entree, and Bread Pudding Dessert!"
5,5,5,4,We picked to sit at the counter but sitting at a table would have been better
4,5,4,4,Came here to celebrate my boyfriends dinner with my family. Great food and great experience!
2,2,3,3,Super expensive. Won鈥檛 recommend.
4,5,4,4,"BONDST is my absolute favorite sushi place in NYC. The Big Eye Tuna tarts are addictive and they have excellent rolls. My only recommendation would be a much needed upgrade to their cocktail program. For as elevated the food is here, there cocktails are basic at best. Overall though I would absolutely recommend BONDST."
5,5,4,4,My friends and I were celebrating our birthdays and this place was recommended by a friend. We booked a table for 6 pm and we were seated after a short wait.
5,5,5,5,My most favorite place !
5,5,5,5,Great food great atmosphere
4,5,3,4,"My reservation was for 3 people but when we arrived my host said that it was only for 2 people, which it wasn鈥檛, and so we had to be seated at a table up front by the bar which was far from ideal. It took a while for our server to come over to us and take our drink order, and throughout the entire dinner people who were standing at the bar were encroaching on our space (resting their hands on the back of our chairs, staring at us while sitting on a waiting bench uncomfortably close to us, etc.)."
5,5,5,5,This is the best restaurant in NYC.
5,5,5,5,One of my NYC favorites! Will visit every time I go!
5,5,5,5,"Amazong, A+, I understand the reputation and hype about the place."
5,5,5,5,We sat at the counters and loved that the chef took our order.  If I lived in NYC I would be there every weekend 鈾ワ笍
5,5,5,5,"Just wonderful. Great food, drinks, ambience, and the service is excellent."
5,5,5,5,Love the tuna tarts!!! So yummy! Highly recommend BondSt!
4,3,5,4,BondST has a great vibe to it and overall a good value..Food is pretty decent and service was amazing.
5,5,5,4,"Fish more fresh than expected, excellent food !"
5,5,5,5,"Top notch sushi, appetizers, nice wine and cocktail list. Excellent service and ambiance. Very Noho."
5,5,5,5,"We walked in & were quickly greeted by John who made sure my date & I got a booth towards the back with enough privacy to chat & talk freely. Next our amazing waiter Evan introduced himself then started if off on drinks & appetizers while my date & I came up with an ordering game plan. Once we were ready it was like Evan had appeared out of nowhere ready to help us eat some of the best sushi in NYC. Throughout the meal the staff were attentive & helpful, making sure our plates were continuously cleared & replaced, the water was always refilled, & they even kept checking in how we were liking different menu items!! Just the service alone was outstanding. Like any sushi pros, we ordered the the Omakase & were absolutely delighted by the freshness of the fish & the presentation! I鈥檇 definitely come back with a date or friends. BEWARE THIS RESTAURANT IS MOST DEFINITELY NOT FOR THE BROKE!!"
5,5,4,4,The food was superb as always. Will definitely be back.
5,5,5,5,Love it.  Great place.
5,5,5,5,I love this place! Continue to come back and continue to be impressed! Highly recommend!
5,5,5,5,"Extremely good food, great service. Definitely recommend."
5,5,5,5,We have been coming to Bond St. on our bi annual trips to NY for over 20 years and It NEVER disappoints.  The Chilean Sea bass is worth the trip alone.  Never a problem getting a reservation yet it is always full it seems.  Seated next to Justin Bateman this time!
5,5,5,5,Food is amazing
5,5,5,5,My birthday
5,5,5,5,We always love to have dinner at Bucaan! Have been going here since it opened and enjoy everything about the restaurant. I wish there was one in Miami!
5,5,5,5,Buccan is our favorite restaurant for a nice dinner or to take out of town guests.
5,5,5,5,We look forward to dining at Buccan every fall when we come down never disappoints
5,5,5,5,"The ambiance, the service, the food and individual attention given to each customer makes Buccan my very favorite restaurant!"
5,5,5,5,"My husband and I really enjoyed our dining experience. We are seasonal residents and try to get to Buccan as often as we can during the season. It was a wonderful meal. Our waiter, Norman, was well-versed with the menu and gave us excellent service. Just a great evening, a great meal and we will be back."
5,5,5,5,We have been going here for years.   Never disappointed.  Always great food and great service.
3,4,5,2,"We[2] arrived at 5:30 p.m. and were seated in the back room, right by the bar and waiter station....way too close to the couple next to us in a near vacant restaurant....big mistake...we should have insisted on a table out in the main room .Our server was terrific....very helpful with the menu selections as it was our first time. Food was excellent and served very timely. Table was too small to fit the various servings.Noise level was way too loud for us.We had much better experiences the previous 2 evenings at other local restaurants of this caliber."
5,5,5,5,Great as always staff and servers are sharp anticipatory of my needs
5,5,5,5,Just an awesome way to experience dinner!
5,5,5,5,Delicious food and great service.  Definitely on the list for a return visit.
5,5,5,5,Love this restaurant which is always more of an experience! Never disappointed.
5,5,5,5,Came for a birthday celebration. Everything was delicious! Highly recommend it for celebrations or date nights.
5,5,5,5,Truly the best meal we have had all year!!
4,5,5,4,Loved our waitress and the small plates (lamb bastilla was particularly clever and delicious). Pretty place with a good vibe and attentive service but for an anniversary our table was teensy and jammed right up next to two others so we had to compete with the noise from both directions to converse. Not that romantic despite the candlelight. Also thought it would be dressier. Many people in T-shirts and jeans which was kind of depressing.
5,5,5,5,Superb high quality food. service and ambiance.
5,5,5,5,By far one of my favorite restaurants in palm beach county if not in the a United States. Everything about Buccan is special.
5,5,5,5,"This place was awesome, as always. Along with Coolinary Cafe, best overall experience in the county.They could do with a better beer list and a signature whiskey cocktail."
5,5,5,4,"Excellent place - moderately expensive, but the service was perfect and the dishes very tasty. Will go back."
5,5,5,5,Best food in palm beach.
5,5,5,5,We try to make it to Buccan every time we come to Palm Beach because it鈥檚 consistently exceptional!
5,5,5,5,"A lovely well designed spot, fantastic food, excellent level of service, great for special events"
5,5,5,4,Anniversary
5,5,5,5,Between the food and service it is a fabulous place. Worth my 35 minute trip from delray
5,5,5,5,Wonderful experience start to finish!
5,5,5,4,We had an absolutely amazing experience sharing many small plates among us all. The flavors exploded on all of the dishes - truly amazing !! Only warning is the cost - can get expensive ( $ 140 per person with tip).
5,3,5,3,Not my favorite
5,5,5,5,Food and service both fantastic.  Highly recommend.
5,5,5,4,Our server made out dining experience perfect. He gave us great recommendations and timed everything such that the evening flowed beautifully. The combination of plates was a perfect balance of flavors.
5,5,5,5,My daughter never visited Palm Beach before and is very much a foodie so it was a no brainer...Buccan.And Buccan did not disappoint. We could only get a reservation for 6:15 but that was perfect because she is 30 years old and she was able to see the happy hour crowd as well.  We were seated immediately and the bar and restaurant was packed (in a good way).Food and service was perfect. She had a wonderful time and told everyone about it.Thanks Buccan
5,5,5,5,Francisco is an incredible server. The food is simply amazing and the management cares enough to visit each table.
5,5,5,5,"Food was great ! Small dishes , but great food . The waiter was fun and attentive. The value was good and a fun place to eat , not a good choice for a quite night out. This place is full of energy and noise. Highly recommend as a spot to hit if your down here on vacation.  馃憤"
4,5,4,3,"Fools was excellent as always. But, once again, service dropped off as dining room got busy. Dining room was also very cold!  Squid ink pasta a favorite!"
5,5,5,5,The best in breed by far of the Palm Beach restaurant market.  Creative dishes that present different tastes and experiences from dish to dish.  We often go and get 5-6 small plates and a bottle of wine plus dessert.  Prices may seem steep but are actually a great value for the money vis a vis other high-end restaurants on the Island.  Just great!
5,5,5,5,"The only thing negative about Buccan is the noise level, it can be out of control.  The food and service are wonderful so you tolerate it"
5,5,5,5,"We dined on  a Jewish holiday and before start of the  Palm Beach 鈥渟eason鈥 so it was WAY quieter and more relaxed than on a normal night when this joint is jumping. Of course we always find the food and service excellent even when it鈥檚 crowded - it鈥檚 the crowd that can be off- putting  at Buccan  with its everyone-on-the-make bar scene and overly entitled patrons. I guess that comes with the territory! Highly recommend the duck, the broccoli and hummus plate,  and the the burrata!"
5,5,5,3,"Food & service were spot on, we had several small plates and every thing was tasty and cooked to perfection."
5,5,5,5,My favorite restaurant on Palm Beach.  Food and staff are second to none.
5,5,5,4,Food was fabulous and very creative. Our waitress was spot on with the recommendations. We ordered dishes outside of our comfort zone and loved all of them.
5,5,5,5,Best restaurant in Florida.  So many different small plate options with different types of cuisines.
5,5,5,5,"My husband and I celebrated our 1st anniversary at Cafe Monarch over the weekend and were blown away. The atmosphere is stunning, romantic and the service is out of this world. Every staff member that we spoke to wished us a Happy Anniversary and made the experience extra special. The food was even better than expected, everything was cooked perfectly and plated beautifully. I can鈥檛 say enough good things about Cafe Monarch and we will definitely be back."
5,5,5,5,"Beautiful restaurant in a beautiful setting. We sat at the bar, where you can order a la carte. Great service, great food, and an overall excellent experience"
5,5,5,5,Excellent from start to finish. Food was superb and the service was impeccable.
5,5,5,5,"I went to Cafe Monarch on Friday evening for my wedding anniversary.  This has to be one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.  I'm originally from NZ so ordered the rack of NZ Lamb for the main course - unbelievable!  The service from Kelly was also outstanding. The right amount of attention without being too intrusive.  Nothing was a problem for the waiting staff.  I also found that even though the first three courses were small, the main course was ample and altogether was the perfect amount of food and mix of styles/types of food.  We will definitely be back here again!"
5,5,5,5,No matter what I say nothing can say just how great the staff and service was.  Just amazing. This is a perfect date night restaurant.   Took my wife there for our anniversary....#winning!  Ha.   This is a must go restaurant.
5,5,5,4,Excellent service and food quality. My husband and I eat here when we are in town. Cafe Monarch has never disappointed us!
5,5,5,5,Birthday celebration and it was perfect!
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding service, ambiance & food. Expensive night out, but worth the experience."
5,5,5,5,"This was an excellent find for us visiting Scottsdale.  I would go there again and recommend to friends.  It combines excellent food, service and ambiance."
5,5,5,5,"I came here for a date a few nights ago and we sat outside. The noise level was quiet, the servers did such a beautiful job explaining the food and the inspiration. I honestly have never had better tasting or higher quality food. The food was plated so lovely, and intentionally. I couldn鈥檛 have asked for a better night or a better dining experience. Thank you!"
5,5,5,5,"If you looking for a great restaurant experience, this is it.  The service,  food is exceptional!!!"
5,5,5,5,What an amazing restaurant!  The food was delicious and the service was impeccable!  I was there with my husband and it was one of the most romantic restaurant settings we鈥檝e experienced.
5,5,5,5,Great Evening in every respect.Will return.
5,5,5,5,Everyone was very kind and was aware it was our anniversary. Made us feel special throughout the night. Great time
5,5,5,5,"A four course set menu that changes every few weeks.  On this night the flavors, seasonings, sauces, and garnishes were a delight.  So many different tastes in one sitting - soup, duck, lamb, beef, scallops, salmon, lobster, and a fillet mignon you wouldnt even need teeth to eat.  Exceptional tastes.  Its high cost ($400 all in for two with cocktails), so save up and take your lady to a treat."
5,5,5,5,"This was our second time coming to Cafe Monarch.  It didn鈥檛 fail to live up to our first visit.  This place is absolutely amazing.  The food is extraordinarily wonderful, the staff goes above and beyond, and the ambience is lovely.  We cannot wait to come back!!"
5,5,5,5,The food was excellent and portions were just right considering there were four courses - five if you had room for dessert
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding experience in every sense - service, food, ambiance!  Cannot wait to dine at Cafe Monarch again, thank you to their team for an amazing evening."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful experience.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing ambience, food, staff and drinks. Exceeded high expectations and highly recommend Cafe Monarch to anyone wanting a great, classy night out."
5,5,3,5,One of the BEST meals we have ever had!!! The cauliflower soup was AMAZING!!! Lamb was absolutely incredible !!! Every bite was delicious .I would highly recommend this restaurant for a meal that is out of this world!!!
5,5,5,5,"Truly the most upscale restaurant in Arizona. The food was amazing, the service staff reviewed every plate when they brought it out. Their wine list is very long. The seeing is elegant and romantic."
5,5,5,5,"Service was impeccable the food was creative and fun.  Best anniversary dinner imaginable, I couldn鈥檛 say enough good things about our experience."
5,5,5,5,As always everything is perfect. We discovered that they have moved across the street which gives more room. Highly recommend dining here especially for special occasions.
5,5,5,5,A lovely place for a special occasion.
5,5,5,5,"Our first time. We were impressed with the service, wine knowledge and excellent cuisine!! The ambience outside is something special."
5,5,5,5,"Great food, ambiance and service.  One of the best restaurants we have dined at and we have been to many top ten places all over the US."
5,5,5,5,Amazing service with delicious food
5,5,5,5,"Overall one of the better dining experiences we have had.  It is a beautiful place especially after dark, well appointed rooms, some would make you feel as if you were dining in a family dining room.  Superior food and service.  We did a wine pairing with our dinner and that enhanced the experience.  Service was excellent and the pace of the dinner was great.  A bit expensive but you definitely get what you pay for.  I highly recommend Caf茅 Monarch especially for a special occasion."
5,5,5,5,Awesome experience - must visit. The 4 course meal was soecracular.
5,5,5,5,Everything exceeded my expectations  food service ambiance was perfect. My only suggestion is that I would have preferred  an option of 3 corses and then desert I was a bit full by the time 4th corse came  by every bit of food was outstanding and we look forward to  going back again!!!!!!!!!
5,5,5,5,"Fabulous restaurant for a special occasion. The atmosphere is beautiful and elegant, yet not pretentious. The food was over the top delicious! The first course of cauliflower soup with truffles was complete umami. Every course was perfectly cooked, seasoned and presented. The wine pairings matched exquisitely. It was truly a special evening!"

4,4,4,5,Service was not quite as good as we had experienced before.  Had to remind them to take my wine order and no offer to assist on the wine selection.   Plates sat on table for awhile after our main course.

5,5,5,5,Everything about cafe Monarch was amazing
5,5,5,5,"Hubby鈥檚 birthday. By far, our favorite place to eat in KC!!"
5,5,5,4,"We ordered the veal scaloppini and the breast of chicken. Both were suggested by our server, Jonathan G. His service and menu suggestions were excellent, as was his wine choice to accompany our meal. We would have liked to see creamer br没l茅e on the dessert menu, but decided to pass on their choices. We will return when in the area!"

5,5,5,5,Birthday lunch for my sister
5,5,5,5,Excellent as always!
5,5,5,5,"What a wonderful experience!  We came to Cafe Provence for lunch to celebrate our anniversary and we were not disappointed.  The servers were attentive, but not overly so, and the food was exceptional.  My husband said the Quiche Lorraine was the very best he'd ever tasted.  I chose the Lobster Ravioli with creamed cabbage and the flavors were amazing.  Thank you Cafe Provence for a great anniversary memory."
5,5,5,5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Kansas City. The food is elegant, flavorful and beautifully presented.  The wine list is lovely and has a nice selection.  The service is always outstanding and the atmosphere, whether dining inside or outside, is relaxing and charming.  The Tuesday Prix Fixe menu is a wonderful offering and a great value."

My husband and I have been to exceptional Michelin star/bib gourmand restaurants in the United states, UK, and elsewhere. These places provide you with an excellent experience and fantastic food that we feel are worth the amount they charge. The bottom line for us was the service was nice, the food was good, but it was absolutely not worth how much we paid especially when compared to world class restaurants that charge nearly HALF the price for an unforgettable experience. Not for us."

5,5,5,5,Best Restaurant ever!! Wonderful experience all around!!! A must when visiting Baltimore.
5,5,5,5,One of my favorite restaurants! My wife and I frequent Charleston celebrating many momentous occasions and the New Year's menu is always extra special.  Charleston is one the best restaurants in the United States. Everything is perfection. I have had the pleasure of dining here many times and it always amazes. The lamb I had here recently was the best preparation I have ever eaten. The truffle soup with foie gras I had recently is something I'll be thinking about for many months. Quiet honestly you just have to eat try the diversity of the menu to experience it. No review could describe quality and taste of food or does justice to all the flavors. You just have to eat it!   A true culinary experience. The service is truly professional and friendly.  No better way to start a new year.
5,5,5,5,Imho the only destination in Baltimore for true fine dining. Opt for the pairing menu to get the most out of most food and wine.
5,5,5,5,Dinner was outstanding from start to finish. Great service and great food.
5,5,5,5,"Charleston is my favorite restaurant.  My husband and I go at least three times a year.  If available, I get the fried oysters (2 orders).  The branzino fish was delicious and my husband enjoyed the black sea bass.  I love the way the menu is listed and you just select what you want, no specified appetizers, entrees etc.  The chef Cindy Wolf is a culinary genius and she makes sure she greets all of her guests.  She knows my husband and I always come the Saturday before Christmas or the last Saturday of the year.  The service is outstanding and you will have an excellent dining experience."
5,5,5,5,I was celebrating my 60th birthday and you made me feel so welcomed! Our meal was incredible and the staff really first rate!
5,5,5,5,Superlative in every respect
5,5,5,5,Food was amazing!!
5,5,5,5,"It was my birthday and it was the most wonderful evening in every way.  From the greeting when we walked in the door, to the service and of course the food.  It was all fabulous."
5,5,4,5,"Excellent as usual.  I was not happy about paying $25.00 a piece for 2 glasses of champagne.  I know I didn't ask for the price before I ordered it, but if I had i wouldn't have ordered it."
3,3,5,4,Some dishes were served cold and had to be sent back. I thought the menu lacked creativity. Everything was done well just not exceptionally like I anticipated for the restaurant. Service was impeccable though and should be recognized. I was not charged for the off dishes and were removed without me be notified which I found refreshing. I will give it a second chance when I return if the menu is updated.
5,5,5,5,"As always, service and food were both excellent."
5,5,5,5,Our favorite restaurant in Charleston.  What a wonderful place to celebrate a special event.
5,5,5,5,"This was the first trip for my wife and I to Charleston. We decided to get the fine dining experience that the city is known for.  We went with the six course tasting menu and let the chef decide on the bulk of the courses. They were all delicious, from the chilled octopus to the rack of lamb. The staff was very attentive and helpful.  We sat next to the band, so the noise level was a little high, but we enjoyed it. We will go again on our next trip."
5,5,5,5,Great food! Great service! Andrew was our Sommelier and server. He picked the perfect wines to go with our food and my preference in wines.
5,5,5,5,"Had an eight course tasting menu, which was phenomenal!!!  Service was outstanding along with great ambiance."
4,4,4,4,Solid enjoyable dining experience Would recommend as one of the places to go in town
5,5,5,5,Food was fantastic with beautiful presentation. Music was additional bonus. Wonderful meal.
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food, wine and service."
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding!!!Adam, our server, and his colleague, Trevor, were outstanding!"
5,5,5,5,Amazing Service. Meal spectacular. Love the live music!
5,5,5,5,Fabulous all around birthday dinner. Service was impeccable and food was delicious!
3,3,4,4,"Convenient as we were starting at the Belmond. Nice ambience with a jazz combo playing during the time we were there for dinner.  Service was impeccable, though servers could have been a little more talkative.  Oysters were just ok.  The crabcake appetizer was Outstanding.  The prime rib was a nice piece of meat well cooked but somehow nothing special.  Potato gratin was terrific."
5,5,5,5,"we did the tasting menu.  It was great.  Also enjoyed the musical duet, father and son on guitar and violin."
3,3,3,5,"I guess I'll be in the minority, but CG is not a ""Go back"" for my wife and I.  Food was good, but not ""The best"" which were my expectations. Service could have been better.  Ambience with Jazz in the background was wonderful.  Just overall all value wasn't there for me (us).  We are local, and we've had better food and service in downtown Charleston."
5,5,5,5,Great experience... great ambience
5,5,5,4,If I had to rate one element the best it would have to be the service. All the staff were incredible attentive and engaging which really makes a difference. The food was really good too  only wish I had room for desert but after eating the 22oz ribeye not a chance!! Will have to go back for that !!
4,5,4,4,"Top notch food and service. In a city of epic chef鈥檚, the Charleston Grill has the best. The only thing that could have made the tasting menu better would have been if we had had the money for the wine pairings. Absolutely 5-star. Get a table away (!) from the bar; it can be very noisy."
5,5,5,5,Superb on all metrics. Wonderful experience.
5,5,5,5,Food was delicious. Staff was nice and friendly.
5,5,5,5,Overall great experience.  Service was impeccable.  Atmosphere is elegant and quiet.  Food was top notch and wine was great.
5,5,5,5,"Our dinner was superb! The food was very good with impeccable service. The ambience was elegant yet relaxing with live piano music. Overall, an excellent choice if you are looking for an excellent evening out."
5,5,5,5,This was a wonderful world class experience. every aspect on ;point.  The best way to experience what the chef and staff have to offer is the chef tasting menu with wine pairings. Special and superb.
5,5,5,5,The service was impeccable without being overbearing. The food was just great and the wait staff very helpful with some of my dietary restrictions
4,4,5,5,Great food and atmosphere perfect for a date night or special occasion! Amazing wine list! The only thing was my husband hates onions and we said not to put them on anything and they where left on.
5,5,5,5,"Charleston Grill came highly recommended. With so many choices in Charleston we wanted a great experience and certainly received one. The service is outstanding - a level about most great restaurants. The wait staff is personable, attentive, and we waited for nothing. The flounder and pasta dishes we had were delicious. Would have like to try several more dishes as well. Certainly one of the best experiences in Charleston."
5,5,5,5,Truly a special restaurant. Exceeded my expectations.
5,5,5,4,Fantastic dinner - we had the crab cakes - probably the best we have ever had ! Excellent waiter & host ! A truly memorable dining experience!
5,5,5,5,Great people take care of their customers!
5,4,5,5,"Had dinner there on 10/15/19. Andrew, our waiter, was pleasant and attentive. We were left to enjoy our wine and cocktail before ordering food. I had foie gras and scallops, while my husband had tomato salad and steak. Food was very good and nicely presented. We shared a side of butter beans. I was disappointed that the sides were limited. The blueberry gateau was a excellent dessert. There were complimentary appetizers and palette cleansers and we left with additional complimentary candies. Very nice!"
5,5,4,5,Food was awesome as usual....seemed to be plenty of Waite staff but had to ask for a black napkin and my sparking water was not filled till I waved to server. Chef Bob would not approve of service.
5,5,5,5,We were visiting Charleston & wanted a fine dining experience. We were not disappointed. Most notable was the foie gras.
5,5,5,5,"We were able to celebrate our 20th anniversary with Charleston Grill.   Our server Adam was fantastic, as was the entire team at Charleston Grill.  Frankly some of the best service I've ever received at any restaurant.   I had a tuna starter, which was delicate and rich at the same time, followed by a flounder served over a local fresh vegetable medley.  My main course was truly amazing, and my wife, who doesn't eat fish, even comments on how delicate and moist the fish entree was prepared.  We would both recommend going there, and we are sure to return on our next outing to Charleston next summer."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely delicious! One of the best meals I鈥檝e ever had. The jazz trio tonight was excellent. The staff was great. Very very happy with tonight
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful ambience, service, and food! This is my second time eating here and it was amazing."
1,1,1,1,"Great atmosphere, service and food offerings.  Impressive (but pricy) wine list. Highly recommended!"
5,5,5,5,Wonderful meal and outstanding service. It could not have been better. Best!
5,4,5,5,Great spot for a special occasion. Entire staff was aware and commented with special recognition of our celebration.
5,5,5,4,Food is what you expect at a restaurant of this price level and it is complimented by a great staff and service.  Very nice wine list with a young lady somm who was very helpful.  Highly recommend this sport for any occasion.
5,5,5,5,Charleston is such a beautiful city and our visit at Charleston Grill was no exception. Absolutely fabulous! Chef Michelle Weaver and staff were amazing hostesses and hosts. We will definitely recommend and look forward to dining with them again.
5,5,5,5,"Great place. My wife and I celebrated her birthday here and we couldn't have picked a better place.  The staff were friendly and helpful, and the food was terrific. We would definitely come back here again. I highly recommend it."
4,4,4,4,We appreciate your staying open late.
5,5,5,5,"Our waitress, Agnes K, was incredible.  She was happy to let us sample a few different wines and help us hone in on exactly what we wanted.  She was very personable and attentive without ever being in the way.  The service alone is reason enough to come back.  The food, though, was INCREDIBLE!  I had the steak frites.  Steak cooked perfectly and the frites were very good.  My girlfriend had the mussels and THE BROTH was so good I ate an entire baguette in an effort to soak it up.  My father would roll over in his grave if he saw me doing it, but it was just too good to pass up.  This was our second visit here and I'm already looking forward to the third!"
5,5,5,5,Cameron our server was great. Wonderful evening with friends and great food
4,4,5,4,Good food. A little pricey considering the decor could use a serious update. Excellent service.
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful brunch in a warm, sunny space. Superb food and service. One of the best restaurants in Georgetown."
5,5,5,5,"This was our first time at Chez Billy Sud and we were not disappointed!  We were celebrating our anniversary and picked the restaurant based on past reviews.  Our server, Aggie was delightful and tended to our every need.  We didn't feel rushed and the courses came out at exactly the right time.  Aggie made suggestions and each one was just right from the wine to the dessert.  It was refreshing to be able to carry on a conversation without a lot of loud noise in the background.  The food was delicious!  The sauteed trout was exquisite and the steak frites superb.  Aggie recommended the Paris-Brest for dessert and it was heavenly!  Chez Billy Sud was the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion."
4,5,5,5,"Delightful, service was very pleasant, food delishious, bake bread warm and crusty, onion soup was perfect. Thank you!"
5,5,5,5,"Great, romantic atmosphere; excellent food, and great service. We鈥檝e only been twice, but it certainly will become one of our 鈥済o to鈥 restaurants in DC."
5,5,5,5,"Terrific experience. Awesome menu, setting and people. Food was perfect, and arrived on time, thanks to our stellar professional table server, Jason. Thank you!"
5,5,5,4,"Menu is concise and varied enough to satisfy all of us, meat, fish and poultry. Every dish from starters to entrees was presented very nicely and delicious. Our waiter was knowledgeable and fun and the overall experience was wonderful. A definite repeat!"
4,4,4,4,"Wonderful Georgetown spot along the canal for great food.  The service is lovely, the ambiance inviting.  It's a must-visit restaurant in DC."
5,4,5,4,"Everything was exceptional. The only thing that I didn't like was that my Duck Confit was way too salty. Other than that, the service, the drinks, and the ambiance was parfait."
5,5,5,5,It was great!
5,5,5,5,Could not have been a more memorable evening in all fronts. Thank you.
5,5,5,5,"This was our second visit and definitely not our last. This time it was brunch, the last time was for dinner. Both were outstanding in every way. The price was reasonable given the overall experience. The staff is great. the decor is restrained but very pleasing. We would highly recommend Billy Sud to anyone, but especially anyone willing to pay a little more for a great dining experience."
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful meal- our waiter Cameron, was very helpful making food/wine suggestions and the experience was terrific.  Felt like your corner bistro in Paris."
5,5,5,5,"Romantic and quaint setting, pleasant and wonderful service, food was amazing. Will definitely return and highly recommend"
5,5,5,5,"Fabulous location, amazingly fresh food and great service."
4,4,4,3,"Overall good food, good service, server was very knowledgeable.  It was a beautiful day and we sat outside - only problem was a great deal of construction noise (noon lunch)"
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic restaurant. Perfect for a date night. Food was excellent, I liked the decor, and scored me major points."
5,5,5,5,"Great place, food is spectacular and delicious.Service wonderful just amazing."
5,5,5,5,"Best dining experience in a very long time.  Perfect for those who actually enjoy talking to each other during dinner!  Food, ambiance, service鈥攍oved it all!"
5,5,5,5,"Food was interesting, tasty and well-presented. We were taken on time and given a nice table.  The only problem was that the rest room was two flights of stairs up and if you have trouble climbing, they suggest you go to the next door bar which has a bathroom on the ground floor.  Other than that..it was a great dining experience that my entire party agreed about."
5,4,5,4,My husband and I went for our anniversary. We started with the beet salad which was tasty but I would have liked more Roquefort and less beets. I got the gnocchi and my husband got the duck breast. I had total order envy because the gnocchi was just OK but the duck was superb! The chocolate mousse to finish was the way to go. So smooth and silky.
5,5,5,5,"What I am always struck by when I go to Chez Billy Sud is how romantic it is...candle-lit if not in reality, in image.  The service is personal in a way I love.  Waiters seem actually interested in you and your choices.  We had conversations.  We chose an amazing St. Emilion that did not break the bank.  An opening salad was dressed perfectly.  I had Duck Confit and it was perfect in its crunchy top and melting interior.  I just love this restaurant...like a trip to France, it reminds us how good life, great food and wine can be."
5,5,5,5,Definitely my new go-to place for dinner when in DC/Georgetown for bi-annual conference!
5,5,5,5,Perfect spot for excellent food and quiet conversation.
5,5,5,3,Amazing food for a reasonable price. The place is small but charming.
5,4,5,5,"Great place to grab a romantic, French dinner over a beautiful, full bodied red Bordeaux! It is VERY loud so be prepared to speak up! We鈥檙e huge fans of the duck! Wait and bar service is stellar too!"
5,5,5,5,"This place is an underrated gem. Creative, delicious food, great wine program, warm service, and a quiet, gorgeous ambiance."
5,5,5,5,Great server. Love the duck leg and chicken mousse.  Never disappoints!
4,4,4,4,Dishes were the chef used his creativity (rillettes with trout eggs; crispy duck breast) were far superior to the traditional French dishes (canard a l orange; steak/frites).  The wine list was excellent.  Our waitress was great-- present when we needed her and very sensitive to our needs and pace.   Very pleasant atmosphere. I would definitely go back.
5,5,5,5,the service was  outstanding and the food was better than that.
5,5,5,5,"We often choose this restaurant for out of town guests.  On this occasion, we had two daughters and a nine month grandson visiting.  The baby did squawk a few times and someone seated nearby commented that it was loud and then followed up to ask if we understood he was complaining about us having the baby make noise.  We all decided that we had better skip dessert and leave as this had sent the mother nearly into tears.  We had, by the way, taken him outside a few times so he would not make noise.  The staff responded by saying they had brought us dessert (we had not ordered it) and they made us feel wanted and welcome. Moved to the top of my list on best service ever.  Thank you."
5,5,5,5,"Always have a great time at your restaurant!Every one, from the host (had to change this reservation 3 times) to the wait staff was just super!The food is always consistent, and always good!One of the best spot to visit when your are in town, not really a tourist spot, what make it even better for us who live here!  A job well done!Thank you, Jens Fisker"
5,4,5,4,Such great food and service! Totally recommend for brunch!
5,5,5,5,"Extremely pleased by ambience, service, and magnificent food.  The most exquisitely prepared tuna and mousse we ever had.  We will definitely be back and must visit when in Georgetown.  If I could give more than 5 stars, would give a 10!"
5,5,5,5,"Simply, phenomenal."
5,5,5,4,Everything from cocktails to desert was delicious.  Service was wonderful.  We are outside and with 32st street closed noise level was relatively low.
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely flawless. Food, wine, service and ambiance was all on point. Would fly back to LA just for dinner @ chi SPACCA! Don鈥檛 miss the olive oil focaccia."
5,5,5,5,"Best people, best food"
5,5,5,4,Fantastic food combined with attentive service.
5,5,5,5,"Our fifth time at Chi Spacca was as excellent as the others. Food is always fantastic, and service is always top-notch. Chi Spacca is our favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. This is a 鈥渘ext level鈥 dining experience without any annoying bells and whistles. Serious foodies will be thrilled."
4,4,4,4,It was very noisy and hot I. The restaurant.It took a long time before our last entree was served.We were just waiting and waiting...Hope there isn鈥檛 too much time lapse between dishes served.
5,5,5,5,Exceptional technique and flavors. Thank you for the amazing meal
5,5,4,3,One of the best spots in town for a delicious meal.
5,5,5,5,"Best experience in LA so far, loved it . The day before we went to mozza and didn鈥檛 like it so much so we were doubting going to chi Spacca but it was great!! The service, the food everything . Seriously the hospitality is outstanding"
3,3,4,4,"Nice experience overall. Service was terrific. Couple of items could have made it better: salt reduction that overpowered the short ribs a broccoli dishes. Secondly, not allowing head chef to use his dirty phone during food prep. We witnessed it several occasions since we sat at the high top cooking area overlooking the cook staff."
5,5,5,5,absolutely delicious and such an amazing dining experience
5,5,5,5,"While my husband and I love every single restaurant that has Nancy Silverton attached to it.  And we loved this one too, however, there was one thing that irked us that I must write about...we ordered the HUGE bone-in new york (even though we were just 2 people) and the waitress kindly told us that the chef WILL BE COOKING IT RARE...and then asked is that ok?  Well, we said no, we like our steak cooked more medium.  She then told us that he WILL NOT do that, that after we get it, (and taste it) we can send it back.  Now what kind of a practice is that?  So we decide to pay $190 for a steak and we can't get it cooked to our liking?  We think this is so extremely RUDE.  So, while we loved the focaccia (which really is nothing like a focaccia BUT is amazing, the steak was so-so (very rich meaty flavor due to a long dry age which the restaurant doesn't specify anywhere...I don't particularly like dry age beef.  I much prefer wet age and if I had known I may not have ordered the steak that night!!!  So, in closing, disappointed but it was a fun experience.  Not sure if I would go back.  If I do, it is for the focaccia!!!"
5,5,5,5,"Delicious , cozy and unforgettable ."
5,5,5,5,Still our favorite place to dine in LA.
3,3,5,5,"We have been the chi SPACCA a few times and the food and service is always excellent.  We were a little disappointed during this visit.  The grilled octopus (one of the best dishes) was overcooked and a bit too charred which ruined its delicate buttery taste that we have had in past visits.  We also ordered the short rib.  The flavor was outstanding, but there was a lot of fat and very little meat for the price you pay for the dish.  The service was on point, and the setting is great- we just wished the food was as phenomenal as in our past experiences. I would highly recommend their Butterscotch Budino for dessert."
5,5,4,5,"Friends in town from Wisconsin and Chicago.  They loved it!  Delish everything!  Especially Whole Branzino alla Piastraherb salad, lemon, olive oil, Roasted Cauliflowercrushed-lemon bagna cauda, and Toasted Pane Biancofett'unta with Puglia Burrata, bistecca drippings !!!"
5,5,4,4,Best food in LA
5,5,5,5,Top notch service and food
5,5,5,5,"Food is outstanding and our waiter was so polite, friendly and knowledgeable about the history/story of each dish. One thing that needs to be improved is having a hostess stationed in the front. We waited almost 10 mins before anyone  greeted us. Our friends were inside already and waiting for us even though they showed up 2 mins before us. Very annoying and hostess didn鈥檛 seem to give a hoot."
4,5,3,5,Great food! Service was not that great.  Waitress was pretty snobby and not very good.
5,5,5,5,"We鈥檝e experienced many amazing meals as a couple, but wanting to make our last trip before we expect our first born special, we booked at chi SPACCA. The food surpassed our expectations. This was by far the best meal we鈥檝e ever had from start to finish and couldn鈥檛 think of a more special way to embark into parenthood than with this unforgettable experience."
5,5,5,5,"Excellent, we sat at the counter, the chefs were super nice and fun to talk to.  Our server was excellent and gave great recommendations.  Highly recommend the pizza bread (not sure what it鈥檚 called) and the cream corn.  Next time will definitely try the chicken, looked amazing!  Can鈥檛 wait to go back."
5,5,5,5,Outstanding.
5,5,5,4,Amazing..highly recommend it..can't wait to go there again.
5,5,5,5,Amazing. Best Italian restaurant in LA.
4,5,5,5,We had a wonderful meal.  The food was exceptional.  The only issue I had was that we found the table to be cramped.  Overall it was a wonderful experience and we will be back.  :)
2,2,2,3,"I鈥檓 a regular to Chi SPACCA and I love this restaurant, Big time. Unfortunately it was a bad experience this time. As a restaurant owner I鈥檓 not here to blame anyone. It鈥檚 more in a constructive way that I write this review. The service was not good. When you pay 500$ for a party of 3 you鈥檙e expecting to have at least a manager greeting you or some sort of hospitality. We were placed on the top edge of the counter even if the counter was empty. We kinda felt like we were punished. The salads were amazing, no comment. I strongly recommend the baratta & peach salad. Chi SPACCA is using the finest products on the market, however, I realized how much butter and oil was added to the meat and sides when they came. When you have the best meat which is already marbled and dry aged ($225 a piece), I find it a bit sad to add way too much oil. It becomes cloying.  It was the case for the sides as well, dipping in oil or butter. Even the bread was cooked on the plancha stuffed with oil, and as if it wasn鈥檛 enough, splashed with oil. The bread was completely wet indeed. I feel like the products and ingredients should talk by themselves when they are that good. It鈥檚 also a question of respect. It鈥檚 really not my type to write a review but I really felt frustrated as a regular."
5,5,5,4,Very good food in an upbeat space. Bring your wallet.
5,5,5,5,The food was magnificent. I relied on our servers recommendations and she delivered. Everything was so unbelievably consistent. Such an intimate experience. Next time will book the counter. Will absolutely be back.
5,5,5,5,The chicken is to die for!! Every time I eat here I leave feeling like the meal was really memorable.
5,5,5,5,"I cannot say enough about this intimate restaurant but I will keep it short.  Wonderful spot, magnificent food with great ambiance.  I have been several times and plan on returning until I have tried everything on the menu."
4,3,4,4,"Third time here over the years and with the long wait time for reservation and price of food, we felt a bit disappointed this time. The cheese bread was too dark and too oily, the charcuterie plate was just ok, the Tomahawk was more fat than meat, although the seasoning still delicious. Nothing was a standout like in times prior. And these are their notable items. Too bad everything hows down hill."
3,3,3,3,It鈥檚 good. But nothing special鈥攅specially when you consider price. Much better places to get a steak. Nothing innovative here.
5,5,5,5,The best in LA! We can eat here every week. My favorite is the foccacia bread
5,5,5,4,Food was terrific as always. Interesting trade off between sitting at the counter and getting to watch the chefs and also having a lot of heat.
5,5,5,5,"Food great , just a small cool space. Loved the open kitchen. Waiter made our meal even better. Focaccia was out of this world!! Worth coming for it alone"
3,3,3,4,"The food and service was mediocre. 2 beers to select from, no cocktails. Wait staff was not attentive. Go to Bestia instead."
4,3,4,3,"It was the featured restaurant as a platinum Amex card member. Unfortunately, Amex can only book us counter seats and not a table reservation. Counter seating is not ideal if your on a date. Both you and your date will end up smelling like food by end of the night. The smoke from the grill, oven, etc. But, if that鈥檚 your thing, go right ahead.The food serving is family style! Huge, shareable! Nothing stood out for us. Everything was drenched in olive oil!!!!! Overpowering we thought! And everything was SALTY! The entrance to the actual restaurant was a little ghetto... small door inside the 鈥渕ozza to go鈥 door."
5,5,5,5,Food was amazing. Staff was very accommodating and made great recommendations.
5,5,5,5,UNBELIEVABLE!!!! One of the best meals we have ever had. Thank you!!!
4,5,3,4,"The food is amazing if you鈥檙e a caveman, which works perfectly for me.  Steaks the size of Buicks, with a Ferrari price tag, perfectly prepared. The maitre d鈥 is more than a little chilly, and seems to enjoy telling why you can鈥檛 do what you鈥檇 like to do. But the wait staff and chefs are terrific."
5,5,5,4,"Food, wine, and service outstanding. Tables packed together, unfortunately we were seated next to door so constant cold drafts from diners coming in."
5,5,4,4,"The Coppa pizza with Brussel sprouts, talleggio cheese & horseradish was incredible. Sip on the sweet potato cocktail (trust me)."
4,5,5,4,"seats are not cozy feeling and sometimes you can hear the conversation of the table next to you, but the food is great and the servers are knowledgable and friendly.  Oysters were great, pizza was awesome"
5,5,5,5,I鈥檝e been going to Coppa for about three years now and there鈥檚 no better place for pizza/pasta in the city. It is the ultimate small neighborhood spot with kind service. You never feel rushed and I love how the dishes come out sporadically - tapas style. Try the tagliatelle and Parma pizza and don鈥檛 forget to make a reservation.
4,4,4,5,Coppa has a nice vibe and good value. Food was very good but not amazing. Would definitely go back. Better for a date than a larger group like we had.
5,5,5,5,Love what they are doing with Italian dishes at this intimate spot in the South End. Some of the best Italian I've had in the states and an amazing wine list to compliment the superb food.
5,5,5,5,Excellent as always.
5,5,5,5,Took sisnlaw for bday dinnerHave been a couple of time. Love the vibe.
5,5,5,5,Loved the food!
5,4,5,4,"Amazing food, the only negatives were the noise level and that the food cooled off very quickly and was cold by the time I finished the plate. The food was amazing both warm and cold haha"
3,3,5,3,"There are better places to eat Italian in Boston. Prices are high compared to North End, so was expecting something to wow me. Food was still good, but for the price I鈥檇 go somewhere else."
5,5,5,5,"We shared multiple plates, burrata and arancini were delicious, highly suggest.  The Bucatini and Zucca pasta dishes recommend along with a soppressata pizza was perfect to share for main courses. Order the tiramisu for dessert.  Neighborhood gem restaurant,  great service and fun wines."
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely amazing place - food, service, ambiance.... awesome! Highly recommend"
5,5,5,5,One of Boston's gems! One not to miss if you are into salume.
5,5,5,5,Excellent food. Great service.
2,2,5,2,"We were psyched to try out Coppa for my fianc茅鈥檚 birthday after reading and hearing the rave reviews. Our waiter was phenomenal and directed us toward excellent wine choices. Other that that, our experience was quite abysmal. Food wasn鈥檛 very flavorful (we ordered the appetizer special, a plate of cheeses, and two pasta dishes) and took a long time to come out. We had very high hopes for this birthday dinner but it really let us down!"
2,4,1,3,"Food is great, service is awful. Hostess and waiters are not up to the food quality. Pizzas are great. We loved the wine. Avoid the Tiramisu, it is mainly Nutella cake."
5,5,5,5,"Coppa is the best restaurant in Boston, hands down."
4,5,5,4,"We had a wonderful experience at Coppa. Delicious food and excellent service. Awesome and unique cocktails! Due to the small size, it does get a little loud making conversation more difficult. Looking forward to coming back in the warmer months to sit at an outside table."
1,1,1,1,Celebrated my mom's 75th.  Terrible food and service.  Really felt rushed and it detracted from the experience.  None of the dishes were anything special.  I am not sure why this place is always busy.
5,5,5,5,We had a great time celebrating our anniversary!  Will definitely come back for wine and cheese with girlfriends or another date night.
5,5,5,5,"SO yummy! Great atmosphere- great service, love this place would for sure go back!"
5,5,5,5,Fantastic menu with wonderful selection of food and drink!
5,5,5,3,"Excellent food, wine and service! Only issue was we had an outdoor table, and when we ordered the tasting menu it was too small for the five plates served. They staged the servings well enough that it wasn鈥檛 a big deal, and on such a beautiful night I was thankful we could eat outside. Reminded me of the little, laid back places in Italy that served outrageously awesome food."
5,5,5,5,"This place was absolutely amazing. We had reservations and we were sat down as soon as we arrived. It's not too big but not too small, very quaint and comfy. The food was to die for. The meatballs are the BEST!! Our waitress was an absolute delight, she was very pleasant and knowledgeable. This is definitely a place that I would go back to anytime. Great job!!!"
5,5,5,5,"I always go to coppa for dinner and never tried their brunch until today!!! Me and my friend ordered some salumi and cheese, a hangover pizza and the fried ricotta donut. Everything comes in generous portion and tastes great!! Definitely will come back for brunch again and try other items on the brunch menu!"
5,5,5,5,Best pizza ever. Great drinks. Great pasta. Second time there. Looking forward to my tenth time!!!
5,5,3,5,Play list was great.  Meatballs and EVERYTHING we ordered were spectacular.  Loved seeing the owner/chef in the kitchen; a true hands on operation.  Thank you!
4,5,5,3,"Our food was, for the most part, amazing and the service was lovely. The whole place was packed, and the acoustics aren't great, if you care about that kind of thing - sitting inside it was hard to have a conversation. That being said, it was a wonderful dinner. It's certainly pricey, but not egregiously so. With two healthy appetites, we shared three small dishes and a pasta, and had just enough room to share dessert.  The arancini, shishito peppers, and meatballs were very good. The tagliatelle with meat sauce was out of this world. The olive oil cake with figs and balsamic reduction - the cake itself was absolutely fantastic, but the balsamic reduction was too sharp and vinegary, it took away from the rest of the dish. The house red was really enjoyable."
5,5,5,5,Amazing little spot in the South end. Homemade pasta at its best-bursting with flavor! The Italian Grinder was outstanding too-meats were cut to order! Don鈥檛 miss it!
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I went here for our 4 year anniversary, and we had a great time.  The food was amazing (duck prosciutto FTW), the service was stellar (never an empty wine glass), and the atmosphere was poppin.  It is a smallish space, so the sound inside carries, but you adjust.  Overall, we had a lovely time with some great food!"
5,5,5,5,Favorite place to catch up with a friend or regroup solo. Never disappoints.
5,5,5,5,Coppa was delicious as usual.  Our waitress was amazing (wish I could remember her name).
5,5,4,4,perfect evening -- delicious & creative dishes that were just the right size in a tiny neighborhood gem
5,5,5,5,The food and wine was delicious... I'm still thinking about the meatballs. Perfect day date with my husband.
5,5,5,5,"Coppa is a wonderful intimate setting in the South End full of charm and delicious food. The pizza is always cooked to perfection, the pastas both creative and classic, and the wine is second to none. I always like coming back to one of my most favorite places in Boston when I am in town."
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, and a fun atmosphere, best way to eat is to get a bunch of plates and share so you can try a bit of each!"
5,5,5,5,It was great. Food was excellent.
4,4,5,4,"This is a neighborhood gem. In the winter, it is cozy. In fair weather, the sidewalk tables are wonderful. Salumi, pizza and pasta - all delicious with a special appreciation for the meatballs. Warm, professional service. A favorite place in a lovely neighborhood for years."
5,5,5,5,Coppa is our favorite in Boston. Perfect at lunch time
4,5,5,4,Wonderful service in a warm environment. Very large portions so come hungry! White Truffle Pizza was fabulous. Recommended
2,2,4,2,"La comida normal, casi gringa. la pasta estaba sobrecocida, el ambiente es muy casual."
5,5,5,5,"I have been there over 100 times and the food just gets better. The service is always perfect. Our favorite server has now left, but our new server was trained perfectly and did not disappoint. Make this yours stop in Miami"
5,5,5,5,The best as always. Our entire family loves this place.
5,5,5,5,I live 10miles away and regularly make the trip. One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Large portions (I recommend sharing) good food and extraordinary service
5,5,4,4,Real very good food and family plate
5,5,5,4,"I dine out almost daily but write very few reviews. I need to write about Crust. The experience begins with a warm and wonderful greeting by Anita, the charming wife of the fabulous chef Klime . You feel like you have entered the home of an old dear friend, so if you are asked in advance for a credit card to hold your table do not let it deter you.  They need to do this because they do  get very busy and they are actually able to fill every table as well as the lovely area outside, but the restaurant seems run so well you never notice and the service remains top notch. The menu at first glance seems to hold a fairly large assortment including mostly  typical southern Italian dishes, but don鈥檛 let that fool you. We began with an eggplant Parmesan that was listed as a small plate or appetizer. There is nothing small about anything we were served. We have sampled eggplant Parmesan around the world and if Crust鈥檚 is not the best, we can鈥檛 remember one better. Even re- heated on day two the crunch of this dish was still present and delicious. I鈥檓 not an olive eater nor particularly into very spicy but the bowl of olives, carrots, cucumber/pickle marinated in jalape帽o served warm was pretty amazing.Also terrific was everything else we tasted: the lasagna, the pizza, the garlic bread. And when we thought we could eat not another bite so packed up literally pounds of food, we could not resist, nor should you skip, the incredible dessert that is like pizza dough rolled into cigar shaped deliciousness, freshly baked, served hot, drizzled in chocolate and powdered sugar with a fantastic vanilla, custard-like ice cream. Roll us home.We had plenty left over to do it all again on night two as dinner to watch a football game at home. If only we had some of that delicious vanilla ice cream  left over...and there is still more lasagna for lunch."
5,5,5,5,"Very large portions, great service and excellent food!"
5,5,5,5,I cannot say enough good things about Crust!
5,5,5,5,We celebrated my husband鈥榮 birthday at Crust and had a delightful time.
5,5,5,5,Just phenomenal!! The BEST restaurant in Miami!! Food is delicious always! 100% consistent!!
5,5,5,5,I love the food in this place! you are pleased with a spectacular amount of food and quality
5,5,5,5,Wonderful place to eat. We were visiting from the west coast and was recommended this place by our Airbnb host. Great food and service.
5,5,5,5,Best food anywhere in a Miami never disappoints.Always have leftovers so love it twice as much
5,5,5,5,5th time here.. Excellent place the service and ambiance is phenomenal!
5,5,5,5,Excellent food
5,5,5,5,"I discovered Crust when I was in a nearby hotel waiting to board a cruise ship. The hotel clerk recommended it. It was fabulous! When I returned a week later after the cruise and was on a layover for a flight the next day, I went back with 6 friends. It was fabulous the second time, as well!"
5,5,5,5,"So many wonderful choices that we鈥檙e returning a week later. This remains our favorite restaurant in Miami. Delicious gourmet food, attentive and knowledgeable wait staff, delightful owners, surprisingly affordable and consistently a memorable experience.  Of course we go back."
5,5,5,5,First visit there and everything and everyone was amazing!!!
5,5,5,5,Crust is great! Twice this week!
5,5,5,5,"Very hospitable service, and Hands down the best bang for the buck! The Food is most flavorful"
5,5,5,5,"You cant beat the experience between the staff especially Anita, the quality of the food, and the value for the price with huge servings. Will keep coming back regularly."
4,3,5,4,"This upscale (for the neighborhood) Italian with a pizza orientation is extremely well run, with soliticious  staff (and lots of them), nice interior, though like most other Miami indoor eateries, somewhat noisy.  Our expectations were high, particularly after noticing the higher than reasonable prices. Unfortunately, the food or most of it, disappointed. Two different large salads were ""bathed"" -their word - in a watery, lemony-tasting dressing that did not enhance the obviously fresh ingredients. But the biggest disappointment was the pizza itself. A personal size $20 experiment with a too-well- done crackery crust, again with commendably fresh ingredients, was ""meh."" I strongly prefer the chewy, European approach; this, for me was unexceptional. Not bad, mind you, just well short of what I was expecting. My conclusion: worth a try for something new, but beware of appearances. Good looking, for sure, but personality-wise, could be better."
5,5,5,5,Crust is one of our favorites.  Food and service are impeccable.  We love this place and recommend it to everyone.
5,5,5,5,The food was amazing and the ambiance perfect.
5,5,5,5,Food was fantastic.  The service was even better.  My daughter and I ran through a torrential rain storm on the way in.  My daughter's hair got quite wet. The hostess/owner brought her a cloth napkin to drape over her shoulders so her wet cold hair didn't lay on her back. She did this without being asked. You don't find this level of service in South Florida anymore. The food was on point as well. We will definitely be back.
5,5,5,4,Owner is lovely. She obviously puts her all into this place. Food and service were excellent.
5,5,5,5,What can I say?!  Except.... This place is amazing! The entire crew is so polite and on point from knowing ur name to hugging u when u leave. Feels like eating with family 馃槉
5,5,5,5,Excellent service and food
5,5,5,4,"Very good pizza! , good atmosphere, and great service! Would definitely go again"
5,5,5,3,"The owner/hostess was so nice and welcoming, she even offered a shot of port (I was too full to partake). The food was delicious. My husband and I ordered the meat lovers pizza and the meatball Parmesan which exceeded our expectations. The portions were also huge; be prepared to have leftovers. We will definitely return and recommend to friends and family."
5,5,5,4,A gem by the Miami River. The service was great and the food amazing!  The owner was delightful.
5,5,5,5,Not much to say. Food amazing as always...love it!!
5,5,5,5,"Always pleasant, customer service and good food."
5,5,5,5,Food was amazing. They give you big portions. You will for sure take gome your meal.
5,5,5,5,Great pizza as advertised the seafood pasta was also great it was fresh and cooked perfectly I would definitely go back
5,5,5,5,"Great food and service!  A great spot for family, friends, and date night."
5,5,5,5,Anniversary
5,5,5,5,Great service and delicious food! Will definitely be going again.
5,5,5,5,Amazing as always!!! A must for everyone to dine at CRUST鈾ワ笍
4,4,5,4,"The service was excellent and swift. Maybe too swift sometimes. We had a feeling of getting us trough as soon as possible. The expectations were very high, but the food did not live up to it. It looked like art, but had too little taste in our opinion. We har the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings. The reds did not meet the standard we expected, but the whites were perfect. All in all a nice experience, but not worth the money compared to other great restaurants we have visited."
5,5,5,5,"We decided to celebrate our 42nd anniversary at Daniels. We arrived approximately 15 minutes early. The host found us a table in the lounge and took our drink order. At exactly the time of our reservation, a hostess arrived to take us to our table. We enjoyed the five course tasting menu, which was amazing (some photos attached) The service was also outstanding! The sommelier was very helpful in guiding us to a wine the was perfect and within our budget. Daniel鈥檚 is not inexpensive, but the food and service makes it worthwhile. Highly recommend for a special evening."
5,5,5,5,Delicious food and lovely setting. Would love to come back again
5,5,5,5,"This is our second year going to Daniel for our wedding anniversary, it was truly remarkable and we were not disappointed at all.The food was exactly what was expected and the service was above and beyond. Everyone was so friendly and took very good care of us during our visit. Definitely looking forward to going back again to celebrate our anniversary again next year."
4,5,5,4,"Food and service was great once we were seated at the restaurant. We arrived early to have to cocktails, but the bar was crowded and service slow. In general, it was a nice experience, but for the price tag I was expecting something even better. Not sure I would come back."
5,5,5,5,Unbelievable
3,4,3,3,"Overall quality is 6/10. We had to wait 20 mins before we were accompanied to our table. They offer jackets for men to wear in the dining room, and I found a used napkin in the pocket of the jacket that I rented. I had a tasting menu: waiting time between dishes reached up to 20 minutes - it was a little boring to wait (looks like kitchen processing is not optimized because I noticed other people waiting with empty tables). Wine pairing was pretty interesting. Food is definitely good but I would not say that the restaurant deserves 2 Michelin stars and prices of up to 1000 usd per meal for two."
5,5,5,5,"One of the best restaurants in NYC.  Great food, service and wine list."
5,5,5,5,It was an amazing experience and the service was second to none!
5,5,5,5,"Worth every penny. Food was excelleent, service was tremendous. It is what you expect if you are paying for a meal like this."
5,5,5,5,You can eat better.French chic classic. Best service possible.
5,5,5,5,"Great, restaurant with a great atmosphere and a very pleasant service. The food (all courses) was superb and the wine was delicious. A great experience, We will definitely come back."
5,5,5,5,"This is a hidden gem. A fantastic place with exquisite food. It鈥檚 not cheap, but for a memorable evening well worth it. One of the finest restaurants in New York City without a doubt."
5,5,5,5,"We enjoyed the experience at Daniel. The 4 course meal was enough, and the matched wines were good."
5,5,5,5,"An exquisite dining experience, excellent cuisine, ambiance and staff. Amazing room which was once Mayfair Hotel Foyer. We have dined in many restaurants around the world and Daniel surpasses them all."
5,5,5,5,Great food and service. The waiter gave my little boy a cute chef hat after diner. So kind.
5,5,5,5,"Beautiful atmosphere, Excellent and the Entire staff were amazing!! Very professional while being very personable and knowledgeable.Cannot wait to go back馃憤Highly recommend giving this restaurant a try."
5,5,5,5,"Excellent Ambience, outstanding service exceptional food"
3,2,5,3,Mala relaci贸n del costo con el servicio
5,5,5,5,Loved it !
5,5,5,5,"We had a romantic dinner on Friday night but most of the customers seemed to be business meetings. The 7 course prix fixe seemed a bit much so we opted for the 4 course with the wine flight. The mackerel dish was superb, the garnishes perfectly complimented the mackerel. I opted for two appetizers (rather than the heavier second course), garden snails simply didn鈥檛 work, the sauce conflicted with the flavor of the snails and there inexplicably were dollops of mashed potatoes (!) I guess Daniel is taking style clues from KFC bowls. My wife did like the rice paper 鈥榗hips鈥.  The tuna main was excellent, fresh, perfectly cooked and complimented by the sauces. Both desserts were excellent.Three out of four courses is a disappointment at a Michelin starred restaurant where dinner for two comes to over $700."
5,5,5,5,This was our 2nd experience at Daniel! Truly incredible preparations! Brilliant & extensive wine selections! Great service! Not pretentious! We鈥檒l go back every time we鈥檙e in NYC!!!
5,5,5,5,"This was me and my moms and two friends very first time going here for my moms 61st birthday. The service was outstanding , everyone was so helpful, pulling back our seats, taking coats and jacket. They were so pleasant to be around. We enjoyed every minute of it. The food was extremely scrumptious. We are all coming back again before Christmas."
5,5,5,5,Extraordinary experience. Service impecable.
5,5,5,5,Whaat can you say about the best restaurant in America? Everything was perfect. The seven course tasting menu was delicious and the kitchen accommodated us by letting us substitute other chef's recommendations for a couple of the meat dishes which we do not eat. It was also great to see Chris again who has been promoted from server to lounge manager. We couldn't believe that he remembered us from two years ago. The service was impeccable and the timing of presentation of the various tastings were punctual but not such that we ever felt rushed. The wine list is more like an encyclopedia of world class wines. This is fine dining at its very best. Highly recommended for special occasions or just for a time when you feel like you need to really pamper yourself.
5,5,5,5,Bucket list meal for sure! It was my fiance's birthday and the whole Daniel team was so warm and welcoming. Unbelievable meal! Thanks!
5,5,5,5,"An exquisite, extraordinary restaurant with presentation, cuisine, wines, service, ambience worthy of more than the 2 Michelin stars it has had for years. Expensive but worth the experience if it's a special occasion and more often if you simply want to feel special."
5,5,5,5,"Have been to mote than my fair share of Michelin-starred restaurants and Daniel is the only one I go back to. Other places may have another star, but Daniel truly embodies high-class dining across all aspects."
5,5,5,5,"Daniel never disappoints! Always wonderful every time I return..Food is on point and the service is excellent! I have been in many of the top restaurants in NYC and this is one of, if not the best in the city, hands down!"

3,3,3,4,"I went into dinner expecting to be blown away by the food and service. Unfortunately I was not on either. The food was good, the plating was gorgeous, the service needs some work.  It was nice to come to a 4 Michelin stars, but we will not be back."
5,5,5,5,"Everything was wonderful, a world class restaurant. The staff is amazing! There is one thing that surprised us. After our dinner, a waitress asked if we want to go for a coffee and he suggested cappuccino. Not sure what the exacts standards are, but this was our first experience when we get suggestion to drink coffee with milk not espresso after a dinner in the kind of restaurant as Daniel."
5,5,5,5,"If you are looking for a quintessential French dining experience, this is it. The service is attentive and knowledgeable. The food is amazing. The cocktails are something special. It is most definitely worth the price for the experience. Every taste makes you feel as if you are in France."
5,5,5,5,We had a fantastic dining experience at Daniel. The food was unbelievable and every course continued to get better. We had an amazing experience with each staff member going above and beyond. Highly recommend!
5,5,5,5,Amazing.   Everything was beyond perfect.
5,5,5,5,Haven鈥檛 been back with my daughter since she was a child. Now that she is an adult we can enjoy it even more.

5,5,5,5,The extra touches that the staff added to commemorate this anniversary dinner were very special and well-received by my wife. This includes the customized dessert and especially the specially printed menus that reflected all of our selections of the evening. Thanks to everyone!
5,5,5,4,"Todo fue espectacular, mi 煤nico pero fue la m煤sica. Creo que para el nivel del restaurante la m煤sica es anticuada."
5,5,5,5,There are not enough superlatives to describe the experience at Daniel.  The setting is beautiful and relaxed.  The service is attentive without being obtrusive.  The dishes are appealing to the eye and balanced in taste.   The white truffle agnolotti is a must have. The staff is warm and inviting like dining with a friend.
1,1,1,1,My wife became ill and we needed to leave. They demanded I pay full price for the whole meal even though we only had the first course.
5,5,5,5,"Del Posto is an elegant, beautiful restaurant. Lovely ambiance. The food is delicious and beautifully presented. The prices are more than we are used to, but the waiter was very gracious about our sharing a salad and having pasta dishes for our main dishes. Cocktails were perfect. Staff is classy and friendly."
5,5,5,5,Excellent. Did the 8Course tasting option with wine pairings and was brilliant through out
3,2,4,4,"Nothing special. Food was ok... many waiters, good service, forms and napkins are changed every five minutes, but very uptight. Good to try once, will not return. Not for a 30-40 yo crowd"
5,5,5,5,"Our second time visit and second memorable experience, from the excellent interactive waitstaff to the creative, complex, tasty beautifully displayed food."
4,4,5,4,"Del posto is definitely a place to have business and adult celebrations. The food was good but it was not exceptional.  I believe the tasting menu is overpriced for what is being offered, specially when you have to add a $ dollar supplement for truffles butter. The menu is very traditional Italian.  It came highly recommended, so I expected amazing. We had a nice time but will probably not return.  When looking at the overall experience, I have to say that the service was superb."
5,5,5,5,"This was the highlight of our 5 day trip to NYC and the Celebration 馃帄 of 53 years of marriage and my wife鈥檚 53 years in Nursing.You staff was fabulous, the food scrumptious and the piano playing a pleasant enviable.We will return and bring our 50 year friends to our next Celebration.Thank you Jacqueline and Harry Rugg"
5,5,5,5,Exceptional service and food!
4,4,5,5,Great dinner that took 3.5 hrs. Way to long.
5,5,5,5,"From food, environment, to service, extremely happy with Del Posto."
5,5,5,5,One of the best meals I have ever eaten. But the service is unparalleled. Each and every person who attended to us enhanced our experience
5,5,5,5,Amazing service from Marco! We plan to return every time we鈥檙e in New York
5,5,5,5,"As usual, Del Posto never disappoints. The food is sophisticated and delicious, the service is impeccable. The atmosphere is quiet and spacious. A great place for special occasions."
2,1,3,3,"Everything was salty. Both my friend and I were disappointed with the menu, given the per person cost of the prix-fixe. We鈥檝e both been to the restaurant a few years ago, and food then was so much better."
3,2,5,5,"Over the years I have dined at  Del Posto several times and never been disappointed.  However, it seems that the restaurant has lost its way.  I was there on a Saturday night celebrating a friend's milestone birthday with 7 other people.  The evening started out well since the restaurant is quite elegant with great live music.  However, even though we ordered the 8 course meal and wine flight, we were disappointed in the quality of dishes and especially in the final course, which was pork tenderloin, and was at best served at room temperature.  The service was outstanding and the sommelier was quite well informed but the food was not up to the standards we had come to expect.  Disappointing especially for the prices charged for our meal and wine."
5,5,4,5,Del Posto is consistently great..a bit louder than we are used to especially with large groups in the main dining room but to be fair don鈥檛 know if we have been there on a Saturday night. All in all still a terrific overall experience.
5,5,5,5,"Del Posto was yet again amazing. I have been many times, and it seems like the food and service just keep getting better. We are so lucky to have this magnificent gem in New York."
2,3,1,3,"Heard good things, however:- Food was ok (I liked my meal but the other two in the party thought theirs was bland)- Service was fairly poor, on three occasions it took about 10 minutes to get a refill for a drink (one of which actually happened while we were in the bar which I really don鈥檛 understand) - Felt like we had three different waiters the entire night- Weren鈥檛 even offered the a la carte menu (not sure if that鈥檚 normal) but had to ask for it; almost came off as deceptive"
2,2,2,3,"Starters are very small and blend.Lasagna has a very strong meaty taste, it was also a little bit burn.We changed it for Tortellini and once again very blend.The table next to us had to ask 3 times to get pepper.Overall a disappointing experience"
3,4,2,5,"Every other time I鈥檝e been it鈥檚 been so great. I think this time was average at best and poor for the price. Service was distant. Empty plates sat in front of us way too long. Some food was exceptional, some just average. They were not very attentive. I fear it鈥檚 lost it鈥檚 magic sadly."
5,4,5,5,"Food, customer service and menu is absolutely incredible. Start to finish a wonderful experience with a great menu/"
5,5,5,5,We enjoyed everything from start to finish. The staff is well "synchronized" with swarm service and create a wondetful experience. They pay attention to every detail. I will recommend to anyone wanting excellent food and service
5,5,5,5,Beautiful venue. Delicious food luxurious setting
5,5,5,5,All around fantastic experience. Great food great service and great ambience.
5,5,5,5,"Move over River Cafe...Del Posto just became my GO TO restaurant for special occasions.To be honest, it started out a little rocky. The Maitre 鈥榙 was inattentive and dismissive of my sister & me 鈥 but not to the men lined up BEHIND us. In fact, even though we鈥檇 been politely waiting to give him our names for what seemed like 10 minutes, he went around us and seated the men on line behind us. Really rude. He later apologized, said he was wrong 鈥 but that was not a great way to start.Then, we asked for 2 drinks and waited exactly 25 minutes for them to arrive. We were told that there was 鈥渁 mix-up鈥 at the bar. Once again, they apologized 鈥 and said the drinks were complimentary. Another bad beginning but a nice touch.Next, we were introduced to the Del Posto menu options: either 5 courses, or 8 鈥 or an a la Carte menu. Seemed a little confusing and pricey but we鈥檇 schlepped to 85 Tenth Avenue from the UES, so we decided we might as well experience the 5 courses.Thank goodness we did. That first course 鈥 seasonal vegetables in a little container sitting on Greek Goddess dressing 鈥 was maybe the best thing I鈥檝e ever tasted in nyc. Prior to that, I must add, a mound of heavenly cheese/creme/olive oil arrived with a warm baguette. What followed was simply perfection. The pasta was like a pillow of sublime tastes. As was the chicken, the pork chop, the desserts, etc.What began as a debacle, ended up being one of the best dinners I鈥檝e ever had. Can鈥檛 wait to go back."
5,5,5,5,The white truffle pasta was out of this world. Classic ambiance and amazing food.
5,5,5,5,One of our favorite NYC restaurants. Innovative Italian cuisine in a warm and classy room. A welcome respite after dining at Per Se (a complete disaster of a restaurant) the night before.
1,4,1,1,30 minute delay before being seated is unacceptable
2,3,3,2,"What a shame.  Booked in advanced and we ended up changing our table size which they accommodated.  Dinner was overpriced, our server rarely spoke to us. Overpriced, overrated.  Would not go back."
5,5,5,5,"What a  beautiful place and a wonderful experience! Service was fantastic; Richard , as well as each employee,  was very attentive.  You feel like a VIP.  We can't wait to go back.  Thanks Marta for the suggestion."
3,3,5,5,"We had very very high expectations.  The drinks especially the italian cookie were great. Service is impeccable as a true fine dining experience. We enjoyed our first course but that was it. We were disappointed with the lasagna it was charred which is a fancy way to say burnt tasting, and very acidic. I ordered short ribs and couldn't even eat it. It was served at room temperature and so fatty that I almost spit it out. My husband had pork chop and said it was ok. I am sorry to be negative but for such an expensive meal I cant let it pass."
5,4,5,5,"Everything about the ambience of Del Posto was excellent. The staff, attentive and numerous, made for a fantastic experience. One comment: the food in general was a bit over salted, which was surprising, as otherwise the pallet texture and flavor of all of our dishes, was superb. The desserts were exceptionally flavorful, subtle, and impressive. Overall, a great meal, will certainly return for all the great things Del Posto offers."
5,5,5,5,Del Posto is a beautiful venue to dine at. I was so impressed with the food and price for a Michelin one star restaurant - it should be noted I went for lunch.
5,5,5,5,Nice food and service
5,5,5,5,The service and food was impeccable.
5,5,5,5,"Delicious meal, excellent service, amazing attention to and care for severe gluten allergy."
4,3,4,3,Good service. The food was good but pricey. All in all it was a good experience. We were celebrating a birthday.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, service and ambiance. The best 5 star restaurant in NYC by far."
5,5,5,5,Amazing overall service and experience
5,5,5,5,"Walking into the restaurant you are struck by the beauty of the space. We had drinks at the bar and, like some classy restaurants, they transferred our bar bill to the table. This is a relatively small gesture but I really like that. The service was tremendous as was the food. I asked the sommelier  to select a wine for us in a particular price range and he picked out a perfect one. Overall, the evening was very unhurried and everything was superb. The restaurant is a little bit pricey and I am generally not a fan of fixed price menus as I鈥檇 like to select my own food. However, the restaurant does a nice job in its selections. I would definitely recommend it to others"
5,5,5,5,Great food and amazing service for my first time!
5,5,5,4,Had dinner there after a Pennsylvania Ballet performance. Dinner is served as a continuous series of small dishes served family style. Choosing those dishes is a challenge and the advice of our waiter was crucial and resulted in a very enjoyable evening. Of special note is that we were still feasting very close to closing time but never felt pressured to leave. A warning that the kitchen was closing but that was about it. Definitely a "do again".
5,5,5,5,Wonderful in every way. Now I鈥檓 fulfilling the ridiculous minimum character requirement.
5,5,5,5,Double Knot came recommended by a friend on the West Coast and we weren't disappointed.  It's only been a couple days since we've been there and I'm craving it.  Each dish was seemingly better than the last.  Go in with an open mind and try some things you may not normally have. You won't be disappointed.  Highly recommend.
5,5,5,2,Food and service was amazing. The lighting made it very difficult to read the menu
5,5,5,5,Treated us to champagne and mochi at the end for our five year anniversary
5,5,5,5,It鈥檚 our go to birthday spot ... took us 1.5 hours to get there but worth every sec!
5,5,5,5,"Truly  excellent, delicious variety of dishes in a fun, low key, yet lively atmosphere.  Knowledgeable servers and exceptional service overall. On top of our list to eat in Philly."
3,3,3,2,The flow of food is when they want to serve. Our food came out randomly and orders were combined onto plates.
5,5,5,5,Went for my husbands birthday and we had the most wonderful time! The service was excellent as well as the food experience. We got to get some happy hour apps* right before our dinner reservation and the staff treated us like VIP when transferring us to our dinner table. Smooth and efficient operation. *Seating is limited in the cafe because its first come first serve. We were very lucky to find the last two seats available!
3,3,5,3,Just average.
5,5,4,4,High quality food with a very nice price point.  Value.  This is one of my favorite places in the city.
4,5,4,2,"Food was amazing. Service was mediocre. Basement level was ICE COLD. Super uncomfortable, which is why this is not a five-star review. I was freezing."
5,5,5,5,"We had an amazing dining experience, highly recommend the chef tasting, creative cocktails, management is extremely attentive."
5,5,5,4,"I didn鈥檛 know what to expect when the only availability was bar seating but I went with a friend of mine from work. It was very intimate, so a good place to take a date. The food was fabulous.  We decided to do the chef鈥檚 special and let them decide on what to serve per course. The chose well and there was more than enough food. Glad we went here and would definitely go again."
5,5,5,5,Incredible experience as always. Continues to be the best and best run restaurant in Philly right now.
5,5,5,5,"I loved it! The atmosphere was enticing and lit by candle light which made the whole place smell so good. The food was delicious, especially the cheese curds. Service was informative and kind. I鈥檓 looking forward to going back!"
5,5,5,5,"We celebrated our 25th Anniversary at Double Knot & it was perfect~ The vibe, food, attentive service, and overall hospitality made our night really special. The Double Knot cocktail, Edamame Dumplings, Oyster Sushi, Maitake Mushroom Robatayaki, Wasabi Yellowtail Roll, & Shrimp Tacos were our faves, but we loved everything else!"
5,5,5,5,New fav !!! Loved everything from the drinks to the food!
5,5,5,5,So good.  best place in Philadelphia.  The room is so cool
5,5,5,5,It was one of the best meals we have had. Made reservations to go back.
5,5,5,5,"First time visit on a recommendation from a friend.  Really cool atmosphere, would have never known it was there and that large downstairs.  Did the tasting menu and it was great.  Manny our server was great too!"
5,5,5,5,"We went for our anniversary. Excellent experience. I was confused because on open table it lets you pick bar/counter seating so I thought that was a reservation in the bar area for happy hour. However the manager was wonderful she understood the misunderstanding helped us secure a table for happy hour for our anniversary and it was greatly appreciated. One of our few Saturday night dates since our son was born a few months ago and we really appreciated the gesture and making sure we had a great anniversary dinner. Our server Joshua was also fantastic. Great food, great service, and now we will definitely be back as often as we can!"
5,5,5,5,Raw dishes and sort ribs/vegetables on robataki menu were fantastic. Weak dishes were duck  bibimbop and duck gyoza. Server saw that we weren鈥檛 eating them and took them off the bill. Would definitely go back as most items were fantastic.
5,5,5,5,Dinner with parents
4,4,3,3,"Had the Chef鈥檚 tasting for two. Understandably, food comes out as it鈥檚 prepared, however, it鈥檚 so much more enjoyable if it鈥檚 paced, especially with a tasting menu or a multi-course meal. Here it almost felt like a race as all 9 of my dishes came out within about 10-15 minutes and I had to eat fast so I could make space for the next plate on the tiny table. They really don鈥檛 take the table/speed into consideration when serving nor plating the dishes, which is very disappointing as a major part of dining at a restaurant is the experience itself. My husband got his dishes way past me, not at all enjoyable. Didn鈥檛 think the ultimate $210 for two was worth it due to the experience, otherwise food is 4/5."
5,5,5,5,Beautiful dining . I eagerly await my return
5,5,5,5,Wonderful place with many seating options. The food was incredible and staff very attentive. Pre-theatre dinner before Hamilton. Definitely would go again!
5,5,5,5,Food and cocktails were excellent!  Service was very professional and informative.
5,5,5,5,"The basement area is amazing for intimate times. Very much in demand, glad I made reservations. Jordan, our waiter, was a delight. We did a blind tasting and all 10 dishes were phenomenal. A chef came to chat with us after and was sweet. Definitely make the time to go!"
5,5,5,5,Love it here!  Food is fantastic.  Menu is huge.  The tasting menu is a great option if you find the choices overwhelming.
1,3,1,1,"Very unaccommodating.  Despite a reservation set for a Tuesday, we were given a small wobbling table that was promised to be fixed (it was not), and refused the opportunity to move to another table.  Food came out erratically; the food of two people were cold before the food of the third was delivered.  Overall, *extreme* disappointment and embarrassment to colleagues for my restaurant selection."
4,4,5,4,Food was very good and ambiance was great for a date setting. Please note that it is very dark inside and a bit loud.
5,5,5,5,My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here and it was so much fun. The menu is extensive and we tasted so many delicious things. The dark candlelit basement made us feel like we had been whisked off to a different continent!
5,5,5,5,Great place for dinner before a show or any night. Definitely very busy and a little loud so I recommend making a reservation.
5,5,5,5,"I absolutely would and already have recommended the Double Knot to several people. Our server Caydie, was so informative and helpful. She was very nice and patient with us while we asked her several questions and gave her our order. And the food was so delicious. We did the Chef鈥檚 Tasting so we could try a little bit of everything and nothing let us down. The Hanger Steak and Miso Eggplant Robatayaki were my favorites! Some other close favorites were the shrimp Taco and crab and shrimp Bao. Holy yum!And I鈥檓 not sure if the Double Knot gives everyone a dessert at the end of a Chef鈥檚 Tasting but when I made the reservation, under the special occasion section, I selected that it was a birthday and at the end of the meal our waitress brought us a mochi dessert with a sparkler and said happy birthday. It was just the perfect end to a special night for my girlfriend! And the mochi was so delicious. Vanilla and chocolate chip! So good and I highly recommend! But to recap, the service was great, the food was amazing and the ambiance was very intimate and hella sexy! I can鈥檛 wait to go back! Thanks for an extra special, incredible night, Double Knot!"
5,5,4,5,"We had a great meal at Double Knot for our anniversary. Our waiter helped us put together a custom tasting menu tailored to our specific palates. Everything was cooked perfectly, and they even surprised us with a sparkler in our mochi and a couple of small glasses of champagne for our anniversary :) would definitely recommend, will definitely be back."
4,4,5,5,"The tasting menu is a great way to sample the menu (dinner). Just remember the party/table must agree on dishes as they are served family-style. We were getting full just halfway through and had leftovers. The sushi/sashimi is fresh. We weren't as big fans of the duck bibimbap (duck texture was not as tender as we would like) & the lobster claw robatayaki was only okay (mentioning it specifically because there is an upcharge if you decide to try it). But we enjoyed the other dishes: yellowtail, uni (also upcharge), avocado salad, kobe robatayaki (loved the mustard with this), crispy whole fish, crab bao, wings (loved the crispiness, slightly salty), and black cod fried rice. We were celebrating our anniversary, so we got an assortment of mochi at the end complete with a sparkler on top, which we really enjoyed as an end to our meal. We would definitely recommend this place, there are many more dishes to try and we will be back!"
5,5,5,5,"Wow. Amazing food, atmosphere, and service! We were lucky enough to try the happy hour menu AND the full dinner menu. The upstairs bar area has great decor and the bartender who served us was absolutely wonderful. The main dining area tho is stunning! It has a speak-easy vibe with low lighting and isn鈥檛 noisy at all! All you hear is the quiet hum of happy eaters. The nigiri was to die for, I couldn鈥檛 get enough of the yellowtail, and my husband was a big fan of the wings and robatayaki! Manny was our server for dinner and he was great! We definitely will be returning next time we are in Philly!"
5,5,5,5,First time guest at the Double Knot - excellent food and service. Would definitely come return.
5,5,5,5,Birthday was a great dinner and great time
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food and wonderful service but the music was too loud to have a conversation, you basically have to yell at the person you are dining with. I liked my date but did not enjoy yelling at him.  Also if you are tall watch your head when you sit on the banquette the pendant lamps are a bit low."
5,5,5,5,One of my favorite seafood restaurants! Unreal food and great service ! The chef even came out to explain one of the dishes to us
5,5,5,5,"Ordered, oyster sampler, fresh, then ordered sea urchin, was recommended and while a new adventure, I was pleased. Then I/2 LB mussels, excellent and to top it off, hamachi, delicate.Really enjoyed the afternoon, sat alone at the counter and that worked great.Would recommend this to seafood lovers."
5,5,4,4,Innovative menu and always interesting choice of wine by the glass. Loud music makes it difficult to have a conversation.
5,5,5,4,great food great view great service
5,5,5,5,Outstanding food with friendly and welcoming service. Can only recommend Fishing with Dynamite to anyone who happens to go out to Manhattan Beach-
5,5,5,5,"I'm from the Chesapeake  Bay, I know my seafood, and this place is exceptional. They also have great cocktails, and a wonderful wine list along with the great food. Go! You won't be disappointed."
5,5,5,5,This tiny restaurant wowed us!! Very small and intimate with amazing food!
5,5,5,4,"We can't wait to return!  fabulous on all levels!  Michelle our server was excellent, fun and provided phenomenal service.  Presentation on everything we ordered was perfect!  The oysters were tiny, briney and so fresh!  We can't wait for our next reservation!"
5,5,5,4,Great food. A little loud though. Very energetic Feel
5,5,5,5,"Excellent quality of both raw seafood (very fresh and cold) and cooked dishes ( ingredients, taste and presentation), and wonderful table and bar services. They compensated for our 15-minute delayed seating with small complimentary dishes of scallops (while we were waiting)  and king-crab legs (as appetizer). We think that was very considerate of them. I highly recommend this restaurant!"
3,3,4,3,I always rave about your clam chowder but tonight the vegetables weren鈥檛 cooked enough. I鈥檓 sure as the evening goes on and the soup is warmed up that it鈥檒l be good but I guess if you come in early as we did they were undercooked the rolls were tad over baked and my husband had the cod and fries which was very mediocre. Not what were used to when we come here usually much better
5,5,5,5,Simply the best! Staff food location ambience!
5,5,5,5,Outstanding as always! You should try their hot earl grey tea! One of the best teas in LA!
4,4,3,5,"Love this Manhattan Bch gem. Once a month visit, but will always sit on the North side going forward."
5,5,5,5,"4th anniversary or birthday we have done at FWD. this was probably our best experience. Staff is amazing and welcoming, food is to die for and this time we brought our son with us who is 3 and they did such a great job making us feel welcome and able to enjoy our time"
5,5,5,5,The food was spectacular. The squash rolls with rosemary butter melted in your mouth. The crab cakes and the equites were delicious.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, I wish I could order everything on the menu! Oyster are mandatory, trust me."
5,5,5,5,Well worth any wait. Food was amazing and I鈥檓 very hard to please when it comes to seafood. Fresh and spot on. Make sure to save room for banana pudding!
5,5,5,4,"FWD is amazing, the raw bar is definitely the way to go, oysters, shrimp, lobster, and the scallops are all amazing. It's pricey, but for the quality, totally worth it. Had a boozy lunch with a good friend, we both left full and ready to make another rez soon."
4,5,5,4,Tiny and tasty! Menu is great. Service is friendly and prompt. Noise level was annyong.
5,5,5,5,Always a wonderful and delicious evening at FWD!!!
4,5,5,4,Excellent food and service. Shared a dozen oysters (so fresh and perfectly shucked).NE clam chowder creamy and rich with potatoes and clams. Market salad chock full of flavor. Grilled octopus was my favorite with white bean hummus. Yum. Martinis rounded out the perfect meal!
5,5,5,5,Fresh & delicious
5,5,5,5,This was by far the most memorable experience I have ever had at a restaurant. The staff and service was amazing and the food was exceptional. This is the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion or simply enjoy a date night
5,5,5,5,Date night with wife.  Great service from hostess and server.
5,5,5,5,Always one of our favorite ms
5,5,5,5,"Hands down, the best seafood restaurant in the South Bay.  Love the chef's creations."
5,5,5,5,Our go-to for celebration lunches!
5,5,5,5,"Great service, prompt seating, fresh and delicious seafood!  Never disappoints"
5,5,5,5,Amazing food
5,5,5,5,"I knew Fishing With Dynamite was going to be good because many of my foodie friends love it, but I was blown away. We went to celebrate my dads 64th birthday and they went above and beyond for us. The food was divine, service was friendly and accommodating, and the space itself was comfortable yet still felt intimate and special. You can tell that everyone in the restaurant from the hostess, to the service and kitchen staff is happy to be there and cares about what they鈥檙e doing.  It鈥檚 not often that I鈥檓 left thinking how spectacular a restaurant was days after the dining experience but that鈥檚 exactly what鈥檚 Fishing With Dynamite has provided."
5,5,5,5,Great food & great service makes for a fantastic meal with friends & family. The staff is always willing to take that extra step to make your experience the best.
5,5,5,5,Great food! Great service
5,5,5,5,"FwD lives up to the hype! It was incredible. And if you go, you MUST get the scallops! I cannot wait to go back."
5,5,5,5,"This joint is tight quarters like in a U-boat but the evening scene by the Manhattan Beach Strand is so hip and cool.  Lots to look at sitting at the 鈥渕ini鈥 counter watching the shuckers prepare my Queen Mary shellfish platter.  It is an awesome display of chilled oysters, mussels, shrimp, lobster and crab.  Washed all that down with Helles Lager brewed close by in Gardena.  Finished off with the Hamachi Crudo, Fish & Chips, Crab Cake and for dessert, the Key Lime Pie ala mode, all were most delicious.  Very outstanding service, always someone you can grab on to.  Strongly recommend FwD if you love the fruits of the sea!"
5,5,5,5,Awesome place. Great creative food
4,5,4,4,"I have been coming here for a long time bc i love love their food and and on Friday they were slow with their service, but they compensated us for giving us the oysters we ordered for free, so overall I thought that was really nice of them to do that, so I鈥檒l be coming back here again and recommending this place."
5,5,5,5,"One of our favorite spots in Manhattan Beach. It鈥檚 pricey, but good. I love everything on the menu. Especially the soft shell crab and of course the oysters. It鈥檚 a fun date spot as well. Super loud - but great atmosphere."
5,5,5,5,"Excellent execution of a well curated, albeit limited menu. Don鈥檛 miss the Bouchees, especially the Panisse Frites and Bacon Beignets. Lovely Prosecco by the glass, too. The pork chop is the best ever, anywhere."
3,3,3,3,"Just not that great. Very noisy, service was very slow, an hour between app and entree"
3,2,2,3,I was very disappointed in the food. I ordered the gnocchi. I received 3 slabs. That is not how gnocchi is generally served. If they were trying to be inventive I鈥檓 fine with that but the waiter should have let me know that I was not getting what I expected. When it arrived I thought they brought me the wrong meal. I actually never want to have gnocchi again. Very sad. Especially because this was the one special place I picked for our trip to San Francisco.
5,5,5,4,A very good meal. We had the tasting menu. The portions are a little on the smaller side but well done and tasty nonetheless.  A very good wine list. Recommended for sure.
5,5,5,5,I am just grateful that Frances is here. Thank you. Every visit makes me very happy. Thank you again.
4,4,3,3,"Frances used to be my go-to:  you could always count on good food and good service. I loved that Frances prided itself on being a neighborhood restaurant that focused on delivering value.  Sadly, as things go in this City, prices go up and quality goes down and, ultimately, we get less and less value.  Same is true at Frances.  From the all-reservation only dining room to charging for bread, it's no longer the charming neighborhood restaurant it once was.Some specifics from our last visit:  $200 for 2 people who had one drink each makes me think of Frances as a special occasion restaurant; which no longer warrants ""it's-Tuesday-and-there-are-probably-open-seats-so-let's-go-to-Frances"" visits.  Besides, our food was overly salty - which has been an issue our past 3 visits."
5,5,5,5,Frances never disappoints. The food is always perfect.I always get the soup. This time I also asked for the soup for dessert.
5,5,5,5,Loved everything about Frances. Cannot wait to eat there again!
5,5,5,5,Amazing food experience. The tasting menu between 2 people definitely worth it. The house wine was prrfect as well.
3,4,3,3,"Great food, friendly staff but felt rushed thru our 4 courses. We asked to hold our entrees so we could finish our white wine but the waiter explained that the kitchen was determining the pace, not the guest. That to me is a big faux-pas, and I pitty the guests who decide to try the 10-course sampler menu as they bring out two courses at a time."
4,5,4,3,"Friendly staff, great food, fun atmosphere, but cramped space.  My friend and I opted to eat at the bar instead of the close-together tables and felt like we had more room.  Very nice place overall and definitely worth a visit.  Would go back."
4,4,5,4,We had a great meal but there were a few plates that were super salty.   Service was great.
5,4,5,5,Lovely gracious experience from start to finish. Innovative cuisine knowledgeable waiter charming hostess great smart casual patrons and vibe.
5,5,5,5,"Always the best dinner and service-very elevated experience. Get there early to avoid the noise, though. Tasting menu is such a pleasure. Long time servers treat me like a friend."
5,5,5,4,"Great neighborhood gem. Not big on decor, and somewhat tight quarters, but a lively attentive staff and dishes presented and plated beautifully! The $65 tasting menu gave us an opportunity to sample the highlights of the menu. I recommend the spaghettini and the honey-brined pork chop were standouts. A very enjoyable meal."
5,5,5,5,Frances is one of those restaurants that does everything right. What struck me was the creativity and perfection of the dishes. Portion sizes and pricing were totally reasonable.
5,5,5,5,"Excellent tasting menu using fresh, seasonal ingredients. Charming atmosphere and attentive service."
5,5,5,5,Truly special dining experience.
4,5,5,4,"but with a full house, the noise level gets way over the top.  A little sound absorption material in the room would really help. Otherwise, great!"
4,5,5,2,"Delicious food, great seasonal approach.But the layout of the dining room is poor. The tables are so close together and you're practically touching the person next to you. Tables have to be shifted to allow someone sitting on the wall to get up and out, and you can't talk with your guest as the conversations from either side are so present in your ear.  It is not a comfortable spot at all, so you'd be best to request one of the 2-person tables along the kitchen or the front circular table.It was also great having the table near to us with 2 small children running around the table and under the table like it was their own personal living room floor."
3,3,4,1,"Tables are ridiculously close together, seriously take a table or two out.  Starters and salad delicious. Innovative and welcome semolina gnocchi with s spectacular mushroom selection, fresh snapper prepared very elegantly.  Nice light cocktails and an extensive wine by the glass selection.  Dessert was truly dreadful, the chocolate creation was dry and really not tasty at all, my friends rum cake was marginal.  This was a bad way to end what was otherwise a fine meal.  Ambiance is seriously lacking."
5,5,5,5,"Frances Restaurant is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco, hands down."
5,5,5,4,"This place was awesome. I sat at the bar by myself, and made a new friend. That being said, even if I had just chilled there and talked to no one, it would have been worth it. The staff was so sweet, and the food was off the charts. I chose to eat the Chef's menu, and was wowed. Y'all check it out!"
4,4,5,5,"The food quality was a step down from what I expected based on my many past and hugely successful visits. Nevertheless, the truly outstanding service, favorable neighborhood  ambience, high value per dollar wine program (a real rarity in sf dining these days), a bill consistent with the setting and product, and low noise make frances a fixture on my go-to list."
4,5,5,4,Superb food!! Worth the wait. Pricey but a great experience!
5,5,5,5,Spectacular festive food
5,5,5,5,First time here & I鈥檓 certain we will return. Everything is delicious. The little gem salad is light & perfect. My bavette steak was cooked medium rare & is second to none. My wife鈥檚 pork chop was exceptionally tender.  SF dining is da bomb!
5,4,5,5,"I was there on a second visit and my friends on a first. The food was just as creative as the first time and with their commitment to a small, varied menu that's extremely vegetarian friendly. While not everything was amazing--the panisse and fish fell kinda short--there are other dishes we're still thinking about days later. The thing that was truly the most spectacular was how well coursed it all was. Nothing came too far apart or all at once. We shared maybe 5-6 things, and we always had 2-3 in front of us. Just lovely. Can't wait to go back."
5,5,5,5,We 鉂わ笍Frances! It鈥檚 a perfect place to have great food with great company.
5,5,5,5,"Food, service, location, ambiance always Superb!!!"
5,4,5,3,"We had the best table in the restaurant by the window. Very attentive and courteous service. The food was exceptional. We ordered a wide variety of dishes and desserts. Loved it all. It is quite noisy, but the food makes up for it. Will definitely dine here again!"
5,5,5,3,"I love Frances. This is mine and my partner's favorite restaurant. We go there for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries. We love the service and the food. And now that they have a tasting menu we get to try more dishes than before. This last time we were there the noise level was so high that we could not hear each other. The table next to us was loud, screaming at times, and it was obvious they've had a few drinks. We had to sit and eat awkwardly in silence because we got tired of having to scream at each other in order to have a conversation. I wish the staff had said something to this table but apparently they didn't think it was obvious that the noisy table was ruining the ambiance of the restaurant and ruining the dinner experiences of the other patrons."
5,5,5,5,"Superb hospitality with inspired cuisine from an ever-changing menu!  The nonpareil service was seamless, warm, and attentive to every nuance!  Our delight with the Tasting Menu was ensured as we revisited a Cavalcade of Frances鈥檚 greatest Hits!  Yes, we left our hearts in San Francisco, but far more specifically 鈥榯was at Frances Restaurant."
5,5,5,5,"Frances continues to be a treat every time. An actual restaurant, where you sit down and are served delicious food by friendly servers. Never fail to leave with a smile on my face."
5,5,5,5,Food was excellent and service was perfect!
5,5,5,5,"Everything was incredibly delicious! Our table of picky eaters ate and enjoyed every bite! All of the staff was warm and fantastic, especially Ethan, who made our anniversary dinner really special and memorable!"
4,5,3,4,"Food was amazing, fresh and well made. Serving was a little to fast in the beginning for our liking, dishes arrived before the last bite of the former dish had been eaten. Staff was friendly and knowledge about the food but didn鈥檛 know what grapes were in their own house wine. We had a lovely evening and would definitely come again and recommend Frances to friends."
4,3,4,2,Mediocre experience at best - expensive but there was nothing special about the food
5,5,5,5,"a great place to take a out of town friend or guest.. as well to celebrate holidays, intimate dinner or anniversary..."
5,5,5,4,"Our waiter took care of us, particularly considering it was my birthday.  He paired the wines nicely, particularly the wine with the salmon.  We got the chef's special and it was a good variety of very tasty food."
5,5,5,5,I went for my birthday food was outstanding service was great had a wonderful night highly recommend it
5,5,5,5,In all senses marvelous!
5,5,5,5,"Every single moment in the course of a meal at Gabriel Kreuther is an adventure in creativity and sensational taste.  The multiple small creations that come out even before the first official ""course"" are a feast for the senses.  The satisfying combination of French/German Alsatian tastes with ultra-refined sophistication is a treat.  Service is knowledgeable and charming.  The wine list is most impressive, featuring many selections to be found nowhere else.  In short, dining at this restaurant is unquestionably one of the most exciting things one can do in New York"
5,5,5,5,"Gabriel Kreuther has a very high standard, and never disappoints.  The artistry of the food is evident, and the service is always outstanding, which is very important considering the multiple courses.  The wine pairings are exceptional as well.  I have brought many out-of-town guests here, and they uniformly say it is one of the best meals they have ever had."
5,5,5,5,Delicious!
5,5,5,5,Outstanding as always. My go-to for a high-end business lunch where you'd like to impress.
5,5,5,5,Truly outstanding in every way. Great creative food and excellent service. A very special experience.
5,5,5,5,Amazing experience! Excellent dishes and perfect service. We will definitely come back again.
4,5,2,4,"At a restaurant of this caliber, we would expect the highest quality service. Our wine pairing was wrong twice during the courses. We also missed a course although our waiter disputed it. Lastly, it took 4.5 hrs for all of our meal to be served. The food taste and imagination is awesome, but the service gaffs hirt our experience."
5,5,5,3,Amazing food and excellent service. We had a relatively quiet table in the front corner of the restaurant and the only downside was that it was adjacent to a service staging area. Sommelier is outstanding! Enjoyed the caviar and truffle supplement. Going back I would skip the truffles but the caviar was exceptional. Overall great experience
5,5,5,5,Beautiful dining room with food and service to match
4,5,4,5,"The restaurant had excellent, creative dishes. The dining room was very attractive, and the service professional, though not quite at a Michelin two star level. Overall, I would say it was closer to a Michelin one star than a two star (and I have dined in dozens of them all over the world), though the prices were much closer to those of a three star."
5,5,5,4,Stunning food - to the highest standard. Great service. Perfect for a big anniversary!
5,5,5,4,We are never disappointed.  The heritage menu was truly delicious.  That said I would still like to revert to an conventional menu.
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food and service.  The duck was excellent and the combinations of foods, spices, and sauces were great"
5,4,5,5,"This was a wonderful experience. The space is a 鈥榝eel good鈥 one, beautiful yet unpretentious. The dishes are inventive and flavorful, absolutely delicious. And the service was perfect... on the ball and unobtrusive. The sommelier was a great communicator and listener. We had a fabulous bottle of wine!"
5,5,5,5,Great evening out- hope you have the opportunity to treat yourselves.
5,5,5,5,"This was perfection in every way - from the service, attentiveness, food , wine pairing simply an opulent special occasion celebration."
1,1,4,4,"By far the worst Michelin starred restaurant we鈥檝e been to - I can鈥檛 understand all the positive reviews. Nothing delicate or finessed about this cooking - smack you in the face flavors and not in the good way. My pasta starter tasted like any basic ragout and was over seasoned. The sturgeon and sauerkraut tart was nice, but we were both expecting more when we heard this was the 鈥渟ignature dish鈥. It all just seemed one-dimensional and unexciting. My husbands fish main was over cooked and completely lost in a sea of sauce that had such a harsh flavor - we usually love lemony buttery sauces but this was overpowering and almost unpleasant. My duck was fine, but by contrast had hardly any jus. We had lunch and ordered at least half the menu so tried a lot of dishes. I kept hoping for the meal to get better but it just didn鈥檛. My chocolate dessert supposedly came with passion fruit but had the tiniest bit of it so basically it was just a huge dark chocolate truffle on a plate. I want delicious surprises on my plate, or, if the goal is to serve me a 鈥渃lassic鈥, it needs to be the best I鈥檝e had. I usually have no problem paying for fine dining but resent the price for such mediocre food."
5,5,5,5,Amazing ! Lovely place
5,5,5,5,Excellent foodie experience with a lovely ambience!
5,5,5,5,Great experience. Worth going if you plan for an special dinner
3,5,2,3,"The quality of food was exceptional and met expectation, however my wife and I found the service a bit flat. We had an outstanding experience at The Modern and was looking forward to an elevated service experience the match the quality of food. Our table was 30Minutes later, but that delay was met with complimentary champagne, so we鈥檒l call it even. After we went to the table. We waited 45 minutes for cocktails after having to remind our waitress twice, and it took an additional 30 min for our amuse bouche. They presented the incorrect cutlery for one dish, and had the incorrect number of years on your anniversary dessert. Overall a lackluster experience given the exorbitant price point."
5,5,5,5,This is an exceptional restaurant with extraordinary food.  Definitely a special event type of place -- well worth it!
5,5,5,5,Outstanding serviceDistinctive and unique dishes
5,5,5,5,"If you want a memorable place, Gabriel Kreuther is the very good option!"
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I were in New York for our honeymoon and it was also her birthday, so we wanted to enjoy a great dining experience while here......this surpassed all expectations.The Carte Blanche menu was truly outstanding with each course complementing the previous. The standard of cooking was exceptional and matched perfectly by the chosen wine pairing, the sommelier was excellent and his knowledge superb.All in both my wife and myself found it to be an amazing dining experience, we are just unsure why it鈥檚 two and not three Michelin stars!!"
5,5,5,5,A lovely dining experience.
5,5,5,5,Cart Blanche tasting menu was amazing!!!  Service excellent.  The wine pairing were informative and educational.ThomasChen
5,5,5,5,"Expensive, but excellent in all respects. They goofed placing the plates but corrected promptly. One of the best lunch menus in town."
5,5,5,5,"A wonderful restaurant, especially at lunch.  Each dish is a work of art and taste.  We went for lunch on my wife's birthday, and it was a memorable event."
5,5,5,5,Our experience could not have been better!  The food was amazing and the service was excellent.  We enjoyed a very special meal at a very special place.
5,5,5,5,"This is a real dining experience.  Be prepared to be pampered for hours. If you have someplace else to go afterwards, I would recommend that you save this for a time when you have no other plans. While the plates are small, you will be absolutely full with the wonderful creations from the kitchen. The variety is nothing short of amazing."
5,5,5,5,"This was a meant as a special birthday dinner and it was exactly that. Despite the hefty price tag, it was a large amount of food and very satisfying. Every dish was wonderful in taste, presentation and service. Staff was polite and knowledgeable. Truly a unique and special experience. I would do it again!"
5,4,5,5,We came to celebrate birthday and had a really good time.
4,3,5,5,"I preferred the menu as it use to be.  I like choosing my own food not being told what to eat , very disappointing experience.  What ate was very good but didn鈥檛 like everything I was served."
4,4,3,4,Elegant dining room.  Multi-course menu well prepared but a bit random.  Service was chaotic and not at par with other Michelin Star Restaurants we have enjoyed.
4,4,5,5,"Food was fabulous, although served in an unconventional manner (some dishes were meant to be shared between two people). The sommelier was excellent, very knowledgable and fun to talk to. He recommended a wine from Savoir that paired beautifully with the lighter courses."
5,5,5,5,An extraordinary meal
2,2,5,5,"This was the most money I have ever spent in my life on dinner for two ! Unfortunatly shortly after leaving I became very ill . Not making any corrilation nessesarily, but something wasn't right.  However the staff was excellent  !"
5,5,5,5,"Impressive, really impressive."
5,5,5,5,"Across the board superb - food, service, ambiance. Our go-to place to celebrate."
5,5,5,5,Perfect experience from start to finish- as ALWAYS!! Service and food were both outstanding.
5,5,5,5,Celebrated daughter鈥檚 birthday with eight guests. The evening was perfect. Lobster tail entree is best I鈥檝e had in years. Service was excellent.
5,5,5,5,Highly recommend this restaurant. The ambience is cozy and warm. The food was outstanding. Our server was so knowledgeable and helped us navigate the menu to figure out lots of items to share (we like a lot of bits of different things!). Absolutely everything was delicious.
5,4,5,5,Food is good but too much emphasis on presentation.  Caesar salad made with worst part of romane lettuce and way overpriced.
5,5,5,5,A Santa Fe institution for a reason. Amazing food had by all served with knowledge and personality by our waiter. Can't wait to go again!
5,5,5,5,A real culinary experience with service and ambience that nearly match the exceptional food!
5,5,5,5,"the elk tenderloin is the best steak I've ever had.  Geronimo and its staff is kind and professional; of a quality that is represented among the elite, highly qualified and of exquisite taste. This is probably one of the best restaurants I've ever been too...and I've been to a lot of places around the world. Go to Santa Fe and go to Geronimo!"
5,5,5,5,"Delicious food, excellent service. We were welcomed by all staff who seemed genuinely happy to see us. Highly recommend to all seeking a memorable night out."
5,5,5,4,"I can't remember how many reviews of Geronimo I have left over the years but if there is one thing that surely runs through all of them, it's that Geronimo is consistently excellent, down to the finest detail. From the cheerful valet who takes your car to the friendly way you are greeted at the door, to how quickly your coat is taken and you are shown to your table, from the food to the service, everything is perfect. I have never experienced this level of service anywhere else. The wine list is great and we both loved our food, as always. Neither one of us had the elk dish this time around but if you have not had it, you must give it a try! At the end, as we were on our way out and our coats reappeared as if by magic, our waiter thanked us and said, your car is waiting for you out front. Whoa! We had not even asked for it. He must have noticed the valet ticket sitting on our table and called for the car as soon as we were finished  paying. If you want a truly perfect evening, go there before any other restaurant in town."
5,5,5,5,"Geronimo is a Santa Fe gem, a restaurant where the food, service and ambiance are all top notch. Four of us each with appetizer and main (or appetizer and appetizer) and three desserts, and everyone said every single thing was excellent. Highly recommended: the ahi tuna appetizer, german chocolate cake and banana cream ""pie"". Amazing. All that said, this is an extremely pricey adventure. If you don't mind the cost, it's so worth it -- even the car valet guy was exceptionally nice, polite and fun!"
5,5,5,5,Outstanding.
3,5,3,4,The food is very good based upon different meals for three individuals. Services and attention by staff seemed to decline as other guests were seated who were apparently of more significance to the restaurant. At least this is the way that it felt. A very long period of time passed without our needs or wine glasses being checked and we sat for a very extended period with empty plates on the table after finishing our entr茅es. For a lower price I  would return for the food but otherwise not worth the cost.
5,5,5,5,"Always amazing. Servers are incredibly capable, ideal service. Jay, who has now waited on us twice is possibly the best waitperson in my 50+ years of fine dining."
5,5,5,2,Always consistent!  Awesome experience overall and Jay (server) was great!!!
5,4,5,5,Fabulous as always!!
5,5,5,5,"On a friends travel adventure, our Airbnb host recommended Geronimo for fine dining. We were not disappointed! Service was impeccable. Food were delicious and the company was priceless. Great choice"
5,5,5,5,Our server Joseph C. was phenomenal. His attention to details and knowledge of the food and how it is served and prepared was impressive. Made our party feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant. Fantastic!!!!!
1,1,2,2,Fancy food that was overpriced and underwhelming. Wait staff trained to have attitude. Wine list with an excessive mark-up. Probably people who need to impress others with their worth would love being seen here.
5,5,5,5,From start to finish everything we had we would recommend
5,5,5,4,"our second time here did not disappoint. It was our favourite meal during our week stay in Santa Fe. Service was fantastic; prompt, efficient and helpful. Food was absolutely wonderful and desserts knocked us off our seats. SOOOOO good. Highly recommended to all."
5,5,5,5,"We were in from Dallas on a weeklong swing through the southwest and found this place. Among the standout foods were the beet salad, the lobster ravioli and the rack of lamb. Our waiter Benton guided us through the various courses and provided excellent wine recommendations as we went. Will definitely dine here again the next time we are in Santa Fe. Geronimo is the perfect balance of personal, warm and inviting while providing a top notch dining experience executed by professionals."
5,5,5,5,The service was impeccable and the food outstanding. I will return to Santa Fe just to eat here again. It was that good! The elk is delicious and not gamey. The lamb chops were divine. I cannot say enough good things about Geronimo.
5,5,5,5,"Fabulous food, ambiance snd service.  Total winner"
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding food, service, and ambiance. Wonderful evening!"
3,3,3,4,"Salad was tasteless Asian pear the salad dressing really needs to be reworked. I had the vegetarian meal which was so, so.  I would have to say I probably will not be coming for another try."
3,3,5,3,"This was our second time there in two years. First time the food was beyond delicious, very flavorful and we were excited to return. This year, I'm not sure if there is a different chef but it was nothing like our prior experience. Food was okay but nothing I'd keep talking about. We were there for our anniversary which they were aware of and they seated us at a big round table that was large enough for 4+ people. Santa Fe has many choices for dinning, we will explore other options when we visit again."
5,5,5,5,Exceeds any level of expectations.
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful evening , exquisite food, attentive service"
5,5,5,5,"The best dining in New Mexico I have ever had!  Food was awesome, wait staff was very awesome, and the entire experience for my birthday was magical!  I loved it!"
5,5,5,5,"Hands down, the finest restaurant in New Mexico! It's expensive, but worth it. The food is incredible and the service is on point. You won't be disappointed. This place wins a lot of national and local awards for a good reason."
5,5,5,5,Great service and atmosphere.  Treated like royalty.  Food was great!
5,5,5,5,"It has been many years since I have had the opportunity to visit Geronimo's and had such a wonderful memory from before. I was not disappointed. Excellent service, food (Vegetarian sampling), attention to detail and attention to our needs. A true treasure in dining!"
5,5,5,5,"Incredible meal from start to finish. Wonderful flavors, beautiful presentation, great proportions. Staff were helpful and attentive. Highly recommend!"
5,5,5,5,FANTASTIC MEAL FANTASTIC SERVICE FANTASTIC ENVIRONMENT FANTASTIC AT EVERY LEVEL
5,5,5,5,This was the best meal ever....  the service and ambiance was incredible.   The waite staff was over the top of any place I鈥檝e been!  The food  was definitely worth the price.
5,5,5,5,"This place came highly recommended and it did not disappoint! Fantastic atmosphere, service and food! Elk was the best!!!"
5,5,5,5,Outstanding from start to finish.
5,5,5,5,"Geronimo was FANTASTIC!, as always.  Highly recommend!"
5,5,5,5,"I have been here over a handful of times and it is always an amazing experience. This time, 2 out of the 4 guests were visiting and they loved the experience. Amazing food, amazing service and amazing cocktails."
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and service! Thank you!
5,5,5,5,It was awesome!! Best place in Chicago!!!!!
3,3,5,5,"Nice place. Great service. Food good, plain good. Wouldn鈥檛 go back."
5,5,5,5,"From start to finish, it was an incredible experience.  Will definitely go back!"
5,5,5,5,Great service and friendly people. Food is creative but feels like home. Lots of flavors and great cocktails!
4,5,3,4,The food was excellent. The ambience was nice. The service was slow and we thought the waiter may have been stoned (or at least on cold medicine).
5,5,5,4,Amazing service and excellent food. First time visiting this restaurant and will definitely be back!
5,5,5,5,"We were seated at the Chefs Table by the kitchen and it was amazing! Getting to see our feed get prepped and cooked made it a truly unique and special meal. Additionally the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. This was my second experience here after about 3 years, and the food was exactly as I remember it, if not better. Just perfect."
5,5,5,5,Everything was amazing!
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful experience! We had broccoli and green beans which were our favorite part of meal! Also tried the short ribs, branzino, and pigface which were also delightful! Would absolutely return!"
5,5,5,5,Exceptionally wonderful!
5,5,5,5,"The food was absolutely amazing! At first we were disappointed to wait an additional 30 minutes after our scheduled reservation; however, the staff quickly made up for it as soon as we were seated. We had an amazing meal, and I cannot wait to go back!"
5,5,5,5,Amaaaaaaazing! We got to sit at the Chef's table without expecting to!
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and service!
5,5,5,5,Kept us up to date about getting us seated.  We got seated at the chef鈥檚 table (worth asking for).  Food and service were excellent.
5,5,5,5,Loved everything we tried.  We look forward to going again!
5,5,5,5,"Great food, boozy cocktails, amazing service, cute decor. Couldn't have asked for anything more. The best part, when you're dining alone, they have offer most of the small plates in half sizes鈥攕o glad I got to try everything that caught my eye!"
5,5,5,5,"This is a great place for a meal with a friend or a group of people. The menu is geared towards sharing small dishes.Great wine menu, attentive service.Like a lot a restaurants, rather noisy, so choose a corner area if you want something a bit quieter."
5,5,5,5,"The food is phenomenal. My recommendations: the green beans (so delicious), pork shank, marinated olives, short ribs, and octopus w/ pork belly. Can鈥檛 wait to go back."
5,5,4,5,Were sat 15min late but experience and food was great.
5,5,5,5,"This was my second time here and it was just as amazing as the first, great and unique food, cozy space, friendly service - I love this place."
5,5,5,5,"Girl and the Goat always delivers. Dishes are creative and delicious, service is top-notch, drinks are on-point. Today, I was treated like a VIP. Girl and the Goat will always be the GOAT! You can鈥檛 go wrong with any choices but don鈥檛 miss the chickpea fritters or the pig face."
5,5,5,5,"This was my second time dining at the Girl & the Goat and it didn't disappoint! It was better than I remembered. My husband was skeptical and tends to not like restaurants like this, but he loved it. Everything that we ordered was absolutely amazing and the service was impeccable!"
5,5,5,5,"Words do not adequately justify what a great experience we had!!!  The food was amazing, the cocktail and wine menus had great variety in terms of palate and price. Truly lives up to the hype!"
5,5,5,5,"One of the best dining experiences we have ever had, hands down!  Amazing service, food, and atmosphere."
5,5,5,4,"The food is really good and tasty. The food is 鈥渢apas鈥 style and meant to be shared. We enjoyed a variety of foods and highly recommend the focaccia and the goat empanadas. The dessert was the only disappointment, way to sweet."
3,3,5,3,"The main entrees were OK, not unusually good.  Vegetable dishes were very good.  Overall the menu and choices didn鈥檛 match the hype.  Worth checking out, not sure I would go back.  Service from waitress was excellent."
4,4,5,5,"Great menu, amazing food. I'm just not a huge fan of tapas style...not at the fault of the restaurant. It's just so way overpriced. It's like the bottle service scheme for restaurants. The bang for your buck is very low."
5,5,5,5,Fantastic food and place. Our waitress Shikaya was very attentive and know the menu and what to recommend very well.
4,4,3,4,"Been trying to dine here for a long time during my trips to Chicago. Finally seated at 10:30 on Saturday night. Bartender was kind of a dick, but patrons at bar made up for it with great vibe and personality. Food was very good especially the vegetable dishes, ie broccoli, artichokes and cauliflower Shrimp dish was very good but veggies stole the show. Our waitress was ok, she seemed a bit overwhelmed place was buzzing"
5,5,5,5,"We came for our anniversary and we鈥檙e seated at the bar seats at the kitchen. What a wonderful experience! We asked our server, Gary, to pick our meals for us. He made excellent choices, including some half dishes so that we could try a wide variety. On top of it all Stephanie Izard was working the kitchen! We can鈥檛 stop talking about it. Thanks for such a great time!"
5,5,5,5,"Ate here at 5pm on a Saturday - crowded for how early it was! But were seated right away. The recommendation of 2-3 plates per person was perfect, and the dishes were delicious. Especially dessert!!"
5,5,5,5,"We had an amazing experience for my fianc茅鈥檚 birthday celebration! The food was great! The goat belly and duck tongue were amazing, definitely recommend! We had aDessert and they actually brought a complimentary one as well! The service was great! Constant water filling and plate changing in between courses! Amazing! Only downside is hard to get a reservation at dinner time so we ate at 4:30 馃し鈥嶁檧锔"
5,5,5,5,Phenomenal meal
5,5,5,5,"Great service, food was delicious!"
5,5,5,5,They are strong across the board. Great space. Attentive but not in your face service and interesting and we鈥檒l executed food. It鈥檚 a small plates format which meant the two of us shared 6 dishes and a dessert. All yummy!
5,5,5,5,"Amy was our waitress, she's the BEST! We love coming here when we can find a good open time slot."
5,5,5,5,First time visiting and it was fabulous!! Loved the ambiance   Our server ( Owen) was awesome!  Gave us great recommendations. The food was absolutely delicious!! Next time I get back to the area will definitively go back!
5,5,5,5,The service and food was fantastic!
4,4,4,4,Great Italian fare. Crowded. Service is fine. I wouldn鈥檛 say it鈥檚 perfection. In fact I thought I had entered a pizza parlor at first. But the place was rocking and is obviously a destination. Wine lust could be better.
5,5,5,5,Best italian food in town
5,5,5,5,"Still my local favorite. The food never disappoints. The wait staff is amazing. Hats off to Jess? for not only dealing with our food allergies, but navigating us through such an incredible menu. Everything was outstanding as always. Thanks chef."
4,5,3,5,"This was my 2nd time dining at Giulia, and the food is phenomenal. After my 1st time, I wanted to introduce couple of my girlfriends to Giulia experience, and let them taste the delicious food. My only concern was service.  One of my girlfriends was late but I called the restaurant several weeks ago to let them know that this happening. My reservation was at 5:30 pm, and they told me that we can arrive whenever but we have a table until 8:15 pm. On the day of the dinner, I called again to confirm and was told that they would hold a table until 7:45 pm and I had to remind them about prior call, which they quickly agreed to.  This was 1st point in the service that I noted but quickly dismissed as it was remedied. But the 2nd one was not great. Once my girlfriend arrived late, she decided to order a bottle of champagne for the table. She asked the waiter if she can taste it, and his response was that he cannot open the bottle just for her, and what he will do with an open bottle if she does not like it, yanking the drink menu out of her hands to show wines by the glasses section on the other side. He could have just said that they don't have an open bottle for tasting. Period. Many restaurants will have open bottles so their guests could try wines, and some restaurants don't but I don't think this was such an unreasonable question to ask. And certainly the waiter did not have to get the menu out of my friend's hands to refer her to the right section of the menu as if we did not see it. The waiter seemed anxious and was somewhat rude. Otherwise, the food was great, and we were out by 8:30 -8:40 pm. I was closely watching the entrance to make sure there are no guests waiting for our table."
5,5,5,5,"Finally got the reservation at Giulia! Me and my friend were planning this visit for a long time and it is definitely worth it!! We got the chicken liver, semolina cake, burrata, and tagliolini matsutake. Everything is just fantastic! The portion is right and the flavor is absolutely gorgeous!"
5,5,5,5,FABULOUS!In ALL ways - Many thanks!Nancy BeanExecutive DirectorNantucket Wine & Food Festival
5,5,5,5,"We enjoyed a fabulous meal for our party of 4, the restaurant was lively on a  Wednesday evening.  The service was outstanding and the courses were timed flawlessly.  The menu selections we ordered were varied and all so delicious.  This was a top tier dining experience."
4,4,3,3,"Great  cocktail, we had a sbagliato. Sfizzi are ok but nothing special. Burrata was not the best one I ever had. Tagliatelle with mushrooms amazing. Culurgiones were good but too much onion. Good choice of wine. Service was good but too pushy, mainly because the kitchen closes at 10 and they accepted reservation at 9.15. Also they split the pastas but we didn鈥檛 ask for it. But overall the lady who was serving our table was very very nice and would recommend her"
5,5,5,4,Excellent service and fine food.The pasta selections were outstanding.
5,5,5,4,"We ordered pasta, fish, and an appetizer- everything was delicious and cooked perfectly.  The service staff was friendly, helpful, and prompt.  We will visit again!"
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding restaurant. It is always a treat to eat pasta as good as what you get at Giulia. Our server, Jess, was +. And the warm almond torta was delicious."
5,5,5,5,"Giulia never disappoints, just a perfect experience."
3,1,2,3,"Fine as a neighborhood spot to have a meal, but not fine cuisine and not authentically Italian."
3,2,5,5,"Second time at Giulia, First time was 5 star. This time after very nice starters and prosciutto we ordered pasta. Both were good but very disappointing compared  with our first visit.  They were heavy, too much food,  flavors you would find in an ordinary Italian restaurant. Just not special. But the service was special."
5,5,5,5,"The service at Giulia is always fantastic, and the food rarely disappoints. It was an excellent dinner to celebrate my birthday."
3,5,1,4,"The food is always amazing, but this past experience, we had to deal with a very rude hostess."
5,5,5,5,Lives up to the hype.  Outstanding food and service.
5,5,5,4,"The food and wine choices are exceptional, and the wait staff very well informed about both. We enjoyed fresh shaved truffles on several dishes. The fresh pasta choices are not to be missed, but deciding which one is a challenge. They work very well with seafood and seasonal vegetable offerings. My largest problems eating here is that I want to try everything, and never have room for dessert!"
5,5,5,5,"The evening was terrific. Superb food, as good as it has ever been.  Attentive, friendly serviceMakes sense it鈥檚 always hard to get a reservation...but worth the persistence"
5,5,4,5,Great variety on the menu and we'll executed. Would definitely return. Thanks to Trevor for finding a place for us  to sit since I mistakenly reserved the table for the next night instead of when we showed up.
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic place!  Reservations are a must, good luck getting one!  The menu is creative, lots of delicious options from multiple Italian regions, expertly presented.  Service is attentive and friendly, never intrusive.  Pasta is housemade and fabulous.  The wine list is short and in my opinion, overpriced.  Desserts are scrumtious.  Vegetarian friendly.  Overall, a wonderful evening, highly recommend."
5,4,5,5,Wonderful food
5,5,5,4,"The whole experience was excellent. We ended up adding a third person and we were seated at the 鈥榗ommon鈥 table but at the end so it worked really well. Our server was knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu and the wine and she made some excellent recommendations. The striped bass in broth was tasty and beautiful to look at, the lamb sausage delicious. Our desserts, pistachio ice cream and almond torts were both top class. A memorable experience from start to finish."
4,5,5,4,"Great creative italian cuisine.Service is always outstanding. The food is fresh, tasty and creative.Chicken liver crostini is the best. Always a great appetizer.The sardinian flatbread with basil pesto was very tasty.Yellow fish Crudo had different textures and flavors.Pappardelle with wild boar is always a must.The swordfish with eggplant, squash, capers and hush cherries was popping with flavor. It was an amazing dish."
4,3,5,3,Flavors seemed mashed together. Very good cocktail. I would like to go back and order differently.
5,5,5,5,"Such a great meal, you will not be disappointed!!"
5,5,5,5,Overall very good.  Birthday meal.  My slight criticism is that my meal as a bit on the salty side.. everything is so fresh and  simple - not really necessary to overpower a dish.
4,4,4,4,"Solid, NY-esque Italian restaurant on Cambridge/Somerville line."
5,5,5,5,This is our favorite restaurant.  It never fails to be vibrant and innovative without leaving the tradition of great Italian food made with great ingredients.  Service matches the kitchen in excellence.  Brava Guilia
5,5,5,5,Took our granddaughter for a special dinner
4,4,5,5,"We鈥檝e been going to Guilia鈥檚 for years and have enjoyed,  Service continues to be absolutely outstanding! However, the food   was variable this time.  While some of the dishes we ordered were fabulous (chicken liver crostini and all the pastas) some were very disappointing (lamb sausage and bass entrees).  We鈥檙e hoping it鈥檚 just a little glitch."
5,5,5,4,"The whole menu, cocktail program, plus wine and beer list are outstanding."
4,4,5,4,The food tends to be slightly too fussy-- a good chef accommodating a clientele that prizes invention over excellence.   The relatively private spaces and relative quiet and excellent service make this worth returning to.
5,5,5,5,"Hands down, my favorite restaurant - exceptional every time!"
5,5,5,5,"Giulia was the best restaurant experience my husband and I have ever had. The atmosphere, the service, the wine selection and the food...amazing! The waitress was incredibly knowledgeable and kind. The food was so fresh. Each bite and flavor combination was just perfect. I would go back here again in a heartbeat."
5,5,5,5,Excellent food preparation and wine selection. Unrushed.
5,5,5,5,Another wonderful night at Giulia.  Food and drinks were excellent and the value is great.  One the best restaurants in the Boston area.
2,5,3,1,"The hostess was extremely disrespectful.   I couldn鈥檛 believe such a thing would happen at a place I like so much like Guilia.  The hostess went out of her way to embarrass me.   food was great, but we felt very uncomfortable eating"
4,4,5,5,"I loved the ambiance inside Giulia-so romantic! The small bite to start was very small but used interesting and unique ingredients. The semolina cakes are not something I have seen on other Italian menus. The homemade pasta was very good but portions were small and we finished without leftovers to take home, as is usually a perk of dining Italian. However, the smaller portions do prevent overeating! The dessert was by far the best part! The chocolate terrine with fresh berries and tart berry sauce was to die for!"
5,5,5,5,The best Italian restaurant in the Cambridge/Boston area.
5,5,5,5,Fantastic!
5,4,5,5,"We enjoyed our starters and desserts. Didn鈥檛 love our main dish, chicken and veal"
5,5,5,5,Wonderful birthday dinner.  Exceptional food and service!
5,4,5,5,"We had a reservation in the main dining room and decided to do the seasonal tasting menu, one with the wine pairings, one without.All of the courses were varied, expertly prepared and delicious. We especially appreciated the spacing between courses, which allowed us to not only enjoy the flavor of each course, but also the overall ambience of the restaurant.The service was outstanding from beginning to end and they easily accommodated special requests.We highly recommend the Gramercy Tavern!"
5,5,5,5,"One of the best there is.  Service is impeccable, unobtrusive, and extremely professional."
5,5,5,5,This was one of mine and my husbands best dining experiences we have ever had. (And we have dined in some great places.) We would definitely return.
5,5,5,5,One of our best fixed price meals ever!  The seasonal six course dinner was great!  And the service is the best of any restaurant!
3,3,5,3,Good was just okay. Nothing special. Overall feels like a tourist restaurant that has seen better days.
5,5,5,5,"As good as advertised. Food is superb, service is outstanding, wine list is imaginative. We鈥檒l be back."
5,5,5,5,"We ordered the lunch tasting menu with wine pairing at Gramercy Tavern. What a fantastic value! The amount of food and wine we received for the price (which already included tip) was impressive. The food was wonderfully prepared and presented and the staff were very flexible to accommodate dietary restrictions and make substitutions as necessary. For the price for the wine pairing (about $50 a person for 5 courses) we were expecting lower-end wines, but the wines were the same quality as that used for their much more expensive dinner wine pairings. I would definitely recommend going to Gramercy Tavern for lunch for a memorable meal at a great value."
5,5,5,5,馃 delightful indeed Thank you very muchChris
5,5,5,5,Birthday lunch
2,1,4,3,"How Gramercy Tavern earned its reputation for good (or great) food is beyond me, my husband and our two dinner guests.  The chefs/cooks appear to have dumped nothing other than salt on all the food.  My entr茅e was so bad that it got sent back.  My appetizer (pasta with Bolognese sauce) was drowning in oil; it was disgusting.  At the end of the meal our waiter did the right thing; she took the cost of my dinner off the tab.  If someone gave me a gift certificate to this restaurant, it would be thrown in the trash."
5,5,5,5,Great combinations on the tasting menu.  Look to return soon.
5,5,5,5,"The food was excellent and the staff was amazing, especially our server Toni who made our experience memorable and added her personal touch of hospitality."
3,4,4,4,Way too expensive!
5,5,5,5,"The food was superb. The service was first rate and really attentive. The deserts were impeccable. Gramercy Tavern will remain in my fine dining rotation for many, many years to come!!"
5,5,5,5,Great choices on the menu. Outstanding service. The wine list is outstanding. Arrived early and had a drink at the bar. Very well organized as they transferred my bill and sat us easily.
3,4,2,2,Reservation honoured 20 minutes late. Place was so busy that main courses were served a bit less than hot! Hostess was dour and overstressed. Could not handle the pressure!!
5,5,5,5,After reading your cookbook and all of Mr. Myers鈥 books I had been  so looking forward to GT and you lived up to and exceeded all expectations.  Our enthusiastic server was a delight!
5,5,5,5,"Our dinner experience at the Tavern's dinning area was nothing short of spectacular. The food was excellent, but even better was the service. I was there with my son and daughter celebrating her birthday. Our server made sure everyone was happy, he provided excellent recommendations and was very friendly. The food was fantastic and the dishes were both the right potion and executed to perfection. Would love to come here again."
5,5,5,5,"We came to celebrate my daughter, Meghan, birthday and  it was wonderful.  Carolyn, our waitress, was terrific.Thank you for making her birthday a treat.The Grosso Gals"
4,4,4,4,"I particularly enjoyed the tasting menu at lunch.  Considering the reputation of the restaurant, it was up to expectations.  Interesting dishes at a reasonable cost for the kind of restaurant it is.  Excellent service, friendly and helpful in a comfortable setting.  We liked the idea of the no tipping policy.  We will return."
5,5,5,5,Ridiculous meal鈥攐ut of sight amazing! Service was impeccable. Our favorite restaurant on our trip!
3,3,4,5,"Good food, beautiful presentation, but did not blow me away. For the price tag and the Michelin star, I was expecting more."
5,5,5,5,"This restaurant never disappoints. The dining room is staffed with lovely people who are attentive, kind and love the food they bring to you. And everything is delicious. This is cuisine in a great setting."
5,5,5,5,We loved the atmosphere and beauty of Gramercy Tavern. The staff was friendly and genuine. The restaurant was beautiful and the food was just perfect.
5,5,5,5,Great place to eat worker are super friendly and a great experience
5,5,5,5,Second time here with my wife. Probably our best dining experience
5,5,5,5,Just wonderful in all respects. Kelsey is a gem!Thanks to all for a great experience.
5,5,5,5,Very welcoming. Lovely service and great food.
3,3,3,4,Sad to report that after many years going to GT standards have dropped. The food was Average at best on the seasonal menu. The duck was hit but the portion size was tiny. The pasta was sausage and clams a complete miss quality you get at a bad diner. As mentioned portion size are so tiny that my kids left starving - which make it expensive given the 184 for the pre set dinner. Hopefully a one off miss.
5,5,5,5,We had a most enjoyable late lunch. Everything we ordered was delicious including the relatively inexpensive market lunch menu and the complementary salad.
5,5,5,5,Great lunch! Delicious food! Kind service!
5,5,5,5,We are carnivores but look forward annually to the summer vegetable tasting menu.  Chef Michael Anthony is known for his prowess with vegetables.  The creativity and deliciousness of this tasting menu is testimony to his genius.   Not to be missed!
5,5,5,5,"Food and service was impeccable as always at Gramercy Tavern, however that level of expertise does come at a price! I like the ""no tipping"" policy, but was a little disappointed to find that the only options in the dining room were a three course or six course prix fixe menu. No a la carte options available. I'll be back at GT, next time might dine at the bar where there are more options."
5,5,5,5,Still remains one of the best! Food is phenomenal and service is fantastic.
2,3,3,4,"The food was good (the chef likes it spicy), but ridiculously high prices for beer and wine by the glass, 3 - 5 Dollars more than Michelin three rosettes restaurant Le Bernadin; staff is strained, maybe because they do not get tips, that's why the prices for beverages are so high - they say."
5,5,5,4,"I loved my evening at Gramercy Tavern! The food was incredible, and the service was terrific. My only critique was the noise level, but considering the architecture and room size it wasn't surprising that it got a little loud. On the upside, the general cacophony covered the borderline pornographic sounds I made while eating the tilefish course!!"
5,5,5,5,Double birthday

5,5,5,5,Wonderful!
5,5,5,5,Love this place
5,5,5,5,The Ritz is always a fabulous experience.
5,5,5,5,Attentive service. Polite and courteous staff.Delmonico seasoned and cooked perfectly.Lamb chops cooked to perfection. They made fingerling potatoes although not on the menu as I am not a mashed or baked potato person.Pricey but worth it.
5,3,5,5,Miramare lost our birthday reservation placed over a week in advance. The Grill saved the night! Within 20 min we were dining and celebrating surrounded by exceptional service and live music. Thank you guys!
5,5,5,5,The vegan risotto is beyond wonderful! The serving team 鈥 again and again 鈥 were true professionals.
5,5,5,4,"A definite must !   Amazing food, wine and service!"
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely fantastic! Celebrated our 30th anniversary there.  The staff, our waiter and service couldn鈥檛 have any better.  Attention to details are their strong point.  Cant wait to back."
5,5,5,5,Our go to dining experience for a special occasion.  Always perfection.
5,5,5,5,Bart made our dinner extra special. He is a true professional and a invaluable asset to the Ritz Carlton!
5,5,5,5,Our 49th Anniversary dinner was to be in a special place for us and base on past Ritz Carlton experiences we opted for the Grill.The attention to detail and overall rendition to the event was flawless and well received.
5,5,5,5,Always Perfect at the Grill!
5,5,5,5,Great food and service. Bart our server was friendly snd highly attentive throughout our dinner. The bone in filet and Dover sole were great.
4,4,5,5,The bone in filet was a little disappointing because of the amount of gristle in my steak. My wife's steak was better.
5,5,5,5,"Our entire experience was phenomenal! Our service professional, Aldemar Solarte was fabulous. Five star service all around -  from the moment we were greeted at the door to the time we left.  We look forward to returning soon."
5,5,5,5,"We had a wonderful Anniversary experience at the Grill Room. Mary , our server was excellent and so accommodating."
5,5,5,5,Had a wonderful evening at the Ritz as usual.  Thank you to everyone.  Remains our favourite place to eat in Naples.
5,5,5,5,"Unbelievable food, impeccable service each and every time we dine there.  Never disappointed!  Thank you The Grill @ The Rita- Carleton, Naples!!!"
5,5,5,5,Great food and Excellent service. My favorite restaurant in Naples
5,5,5,5,So nice to be back in our favourite restaurant now we are back in town. So nice to see everyone. Food is always exceptional.
5,5,5,5,It was a wonderful experience celebrating my birthday with out of town family in such a lovely atmosphere.  The food and service was excellent.
5,5,5,5,"We had a wonderful birthday dinner!!  Matt was terrific, as was all the staff!  Everyone is always so welcoming!  Food was perfect and service could not have been better!!  Many thanks!!"
5,4,5,4,"Dining Room is too dark - can't see what you are eating.  Very expensive and grossly over priced.Service was great.Unfortunately, everyone who ordered salad got sick."
5,5,5,5,"Amazing experience! Best service, special steakhouse atmosphere, and the meal was prepared perfectly!"
5,5,5,5,Anniversary
5,5,5,5,Anniversary and they made us feel very special. It was lovely
5,5,5,5,"The table location, service, food wine and drinks were all excellent!It was our 25th anniversary and the entire staff made it a night to remember!"
4,2,5,4,"Lovely place with excellent service.  Problem was this is ""The Grill""  and has a high price point so most everything should be close to perfect.  My requested Delmonico steak done medium came out medium rare to rare.  Mistakes happen, but when I sent it back to get more cooked, it still came out red medium rare rather than pink medium. Unacceptable for a high priced steak joint.  Offer was made to cook it a third time, but too late as my wife was eating her meal slowly and it was getting cold.  I ate some of the more done parts of the steak and left the rest.   Excellent service and the server did the right thing by comping my steak, but it was a bummer for my fancy anniversary dinner, and a place like The Grill should not need 3 times to cook meat to the right temp."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful experience
5,5,5,5,Delicious food in a lovely setting. The waitstaff were pleasant and attentive but also allowed us to enjoy our food at a leisurely pace. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
5,5,5,5,Love the live pianist and especially the guitarist during the dinner. The meal was delicious as always. Awesome staff!
4,3,5,5,"Nice atmosphere. Service excellent. Food good, not great. Very pricey, but it is The Ritz Carlton."
5,5,5,5,"Great food, impeccable service and amazing wine list!"
5,5,5,5,It was truly prefect. Service and food top notch
5,5,5,5,Love the service and the food
5,5,5,5,Wonderful restaurant to celebrate an anniversary dinner!
5,5,5,5,We enjoyed our anniversary dinner at the Grill Room
5,5,5,5,The team at the grill was Awesome! Scott and Claudette impeccable service for our wedding anniversary! Thank you 馃槉
5,5,5,5,"This top scale restaurant and staff are amazing! We had a large group and underestimated the size in the private dining room. The staff was just absolutely wonderful, speedy, very professional and attentive as they quickly accommodated our group. The food was impeccable and delicious, the service supreme--they basically saved the day. Thank you all so much for a wonderful experience! Bart and Scott were our designated wait staff and their professionalism and attention to detail was the best I have ever seen (and I am accustom to fine dining around the world).What could have been a stressful situation was enjoyable and relaxing. Each of our guests was very complimentary. The Grill team gets all the credit!"

5,0,0,0,Great location! Exceptional food and service. This place is must visit if in Charleston.
5,0,0,0,Best steak I have ever had !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,0,0,0,Best in Charleston and maybe in the USA. Food-Service Perfection
5,0,0,0,We decided to try Halls for dinner since everyone said it was so good and man it was AMAZING!! I would definitely come back to this restaurant and recommend it to everyone. The filet was awesome and the best side was the creamed corn! I got the Filet over mushroom risotto. Everyone that was with us enjoyed their meal and did nothing but raved about it all weekend.
5,5,5,4,A very enjoyable experience from start to finish. Tyler and Shawna were both awesome.
5,5,5,5,Absolutely amazing food and staff! Can鈥檛 wait to take my wife back! Get the bone in filet if available.
5,5,5,5,Just incredible-we loved our evening there!
5,5,5,4,"Our meal was superb and the service was outstanding. Loved the special birthday dessert which was generous, delicious, and came with champagne for all! A perfect family celebration of a special birthday."
5,5,5,5,Unbelievably the best restaurant we鈥檝e ever been too! From the greeting at the door to the wonderful service from our waitress Megan we were blown away!!! The steaks are amazing and cooked to perfection! Bread pudding is a must for dessert! Can鈥檛 wait to go back when we are back in SC!
5,5,5,5,The meal was exceptional! Even received a hand written thank you card in the mail afterwards! Didn't like that you needed to Valet park and the it very noisy but the food was out of this world. We would go back in a heartbeat!
5,5,5,5,"Our server was delightful and very helpful. We were 2 women, and didn鈥檛 want to overeat, so w truly appreciated her guidance with the menu selection.  We started with a Pomegranate martini, and it was delicious. The veal chop was perfect, as were our sides.  It was our first time in Charleston, and I鈥檓 sure we鈥檒l be back, and definitely come  back to Hall鈥檚."
5,5,5,5,"This was our second visit to Hall's Chophouse, but our first for their brunch.  We both enjoyed a cup of she crab soup, I had the crab cakes benedict and my husband had a bone in rib eye with mashed potatoes.  Both dishes were outstanding!  I wish I could eat there every day.  Loved talking with the owner and the staff.  They made us feel welcome and they were glad we decided to join them.  Oh, and the gospel singers were out of this world.  We had a great time.  We'll be back."
5,5,5,5,This was our first time and the waiter was very helpful.  He asked us what we like and then made suggestions based on the information we gave.  It was my birthday and I do like the fact I didn't have to pull my drivers license out to prove it.  I look forward to the next time.
1,0,0,0,"Full disclosure: I never made it to dinner.Restaurant staff informed me that they would call me and let me know if they would be open following a recent hurricane scare.  Never got a call and missed what I had hoped was going to be great birthday for my wife.  Things get crazy on the coast during a hurricane event and things like forgetting about a reservation you promised to call are going to happen at even the best establishments.  I really want to like this restaurant, as they have plans to open a location near me, so I will wait another 3 months for a Saturday night to open up and give it a second chance.  This review will be updated at that time.  In the meantime, I would recommend other diners be vigilant and double check reservations and conversations with restaurant staff."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely an amazing experience!! The food was out of this world and staff was exceptional. This is an absolute Charleston MUST!!!!
5,5,5,5,Birthday dinner was phenomenal
5,5,5,5,Excellent food and service.  We love this place.  Best food and service around.
5,5,5,5,Awesome every time鈥 a must stop while in the area Great bar dining as well
5,5,5,5,HANDS DOWN THIS WAS OUR BEST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!
5,5,5,5,We are Charleston locals and finally made it to Halls to celebrate my husband and I鈥檚 Birthdays. The service was impeccable and our dinner was perfect. We had very high expectations going in and they were exceeded! We will definitely be back to Halls!
5,5,5,5,Went above and beyond to make it a very personal experience for a recent engagement
5,5,5,5,"Visited after relocating from Texas to Charlotte.  This was the best meal, service & steak that I've ever eaten - EVER.  The owners are people friendly, and love to mingle amongst their guest.  GREAT JELLY BEANS!!!!  This is a restaurant you will not want to miss!!!"
5,5,5,5,When in Charleston dining at Halls Chop House and other Hall Family owned restaurants is a MUST!
5,5,5,5,Billy Hall is a legend . Went down for my Bachelor party with a group of 12. Outstanding steak and great service. The owner ( Billy) shakes everyone鈥檚 hand as they walk in and visits every table. The personalized dining experience is a lost art.
5,5,5,5,The place was phenomenal.  The food was spot on.  Would recommend for dinner.
5,5,5,5,"We consider Hall's Chophouse Charleston to be the finest restaurant in Charleston.  Plain and simple.  We walk in the front door to be greeted by Billy Hall who immediately makes us feel like family!  We are always greeted by genuine smiles by the entire staff.  The waiters / waitresses are routinely right there when we need them and inconspicuous when we don't need them.  The food is cooked to perfection (once delivered to our table, the waiter always makes us cut our steak to check the cook of the meat).  The waiter's knowledge of the menu is extraordinary.If I had a complaint, it would be that our dinner is always so delicious and filling that we never have room to try your desserts.  We're gonna have to work on that!Thank you Hall Family and Hall's Chophouse for always making us feel like part of your extended family."
5,5,5,5,"We had a fantastic meal, visiting for a special occasion. For starter, I had the best onion soup I have ever had. It had the addition of onion rings piled on top and I have asked my wife to add it to her own recipe!I then had a delicious steak whilst my wife had the succulent lamb. I finished with a yum bread pudding with a whiskey sauce. Not a cheap meal but absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend a visit."
5,5,5,5,Great time with visiting family. Folks were great with our 3 grandsons!!
5,5,5,5,Our favorite Charleston spot by far!   The staff and the family of Hall鈥檚 are incredible.   Food is always amazing.
5,5,5,5,"Have heard of Halls for ages, but never had indulged on one of my frequent trips to Charleston. The reputation is for excellent food and outstanding service. My son, on an earlier visit with friends, proclaimed to the world that he had enjoyed the best steak he鈥檇 ever eaten. My two friends and I concurred that the service was superb and the steaks among the best ever. However, there was one shortcoming: the onion rings!!! I consider myself a connoisseur. The onion rings served that evening were very large - fine - but coated in a heavy, doughy batter. The batter must be light, flaky. Overall perfection is so close. Let the onion rings lead Halls to its culinary apotheosis!!!"
5,5,5,5,Best Restaurant in the US!!!
5,5,5,5,Food and service were absolutely amazing and the handwritten thank you note that followed was definitely a special touch.  Probably the best restaurant I've found in SC.
5,5,5,5,Service was amazing! Worth every penny! Dina was our server and went above and beyond!
5,5,5,5,"BEST EVER!  We went for the gospel brunch and decided to go back for dinner the next day.  We never repeat restaurants when on vacay but this was a must!  The owner was extremely hospitable and made us feel like VIP guests and looking around the restaurant, everyone was treated that way.  Best food and service in Charleston and probably the US.  I will visit every trip and tell all my friends!"
5,5,5,5,"If you know you will be in  Charleston on a Sunday morning, please make reservations for the Gospel Brunch at Halls.  The food was fantastic, the service was flawless and the music was great!  Billy Hall was there the moment we walked in the door with a lovely greeting, and he even checked in a few times to see if were were enjoying our meal.  I have never experienced customer service like this.  True southern charm.  We will be back the next time we are in Charleston."
5,5,5,5,Waiter was very attentive. We had reservations and got seated promptly. Or steak was cooked a perfect medium rare just like we requested.
5,5,5,5,Literally the best dinner of my life. The customer service and quality of food were amazing! Mr. Hall was there and was so kind and took care of two of the guys who鈥檚 birthdays we were celebrating. We got a thank you card in the mail after. I would go back in a heart beat and plan on it!
5,5,5,5,Excellent service as always.
5,5,5,5,Best gospel Sunday brunch!!!  Never been disappointed.
5,5,5,5,"Fabulous in every way, except no one told us there was a two hour time limit due to another reservation after ours, and they asked if I wanted a third drink with 10 minutes left. I would have liked more time so as to enjoy the drink instead of gulping down a $15 cocktail when we were told our time was up."
1,1,1,1,This place is a joke. Save your money.  Service is poor. Staff is rude. I would never go back to this establishment.
5,5,5,5,Great drinks in a cool atmosphere.
5,4,5,5,Very cool place! Will definitely be back!
4,4,5,5,Just a very chill vibe. Relaxed. Great cocktails.
4,5,3,4,"This is a great speakeasy for a date-night. The menu isn't extensive, but the execution is solid and they don't skimp on you. We got the cheese plate, meatballs, and brussel sprouts and were quite satisfied. The cocktails we tried were also really nice.  One thing to keep in mind is that the music is kept fairly loud even when the restaurant is not very full, which may not be the vibe you're looking for."
4,4,5,5,Cool speakeasy venue. Stairway dark. Cool hidden bathrooms    Fun atmosphere. Limit food choices.  Pricey. Won鈥檛 take cash
5,5,5,5,As usual HB delivered great atmosphere and wonderful drinks!
5,5,5,5,"Excellent ambiance, service and people! Perfect for a date"
5,5,5,5,"Fun speakeasy in Eastern Market.  The third time we've been there and we bring different friends each time.  The drinks are great, and to really take advantage of their mixology skills you need to give them a few hints and let them create something for you.  We didn't get any food this time.   It is expensive but the experience is worth it."
5,5,5,5,One of the best speakeasy bars in the city! Loved the drinks and the ambiance.
1,3,1,5,Terrible service. Sat there for two hours and was only served two drinks
3,3,3,5,Fantastic ambiance! Cocktails were fine but honestly nothing special special about them. Service was 鈥渕eh鈥. Worth it for the ambiance though!
5,5,5,5,"As always, absolutely amazing experience. Great service and talented bartenders."
1,5,1,5,"Unfortunately one of the bigger disappointments I鈥檝e had in DC. Wonderful atmosphere and decor, but the worst bar tending experience I鈥檝e had. The bartender asked order, made several drinks in front of us, and then after 15min, asked our order again. 15min later, she asked us again. Then after another 10 she brought us one drink (there were two is us) that wasn鈥檛 remotely what we ordered. So 45min after we first ordered we got our drinks. There were only about 12-15 of us in the entire bar so it was rather surprising. Throughout the night the bartender also repeatedly spilled iced on the bar and therefore us. Heard so much about this bar, but unfortunately this wasn鈥檛 its night."
5,4,5,5,"Great speak easy with an old world vibe. Walk in a secret entrance and knock on an unmarked door to enter a candle lit, quiet, rustic bar."
4,2,4,0,"Service was not great, as usual, there and in Aqua al Due, its owner.  Hoping it will improve soon."
5,5,5,5,"Harold Black is a great 鈥渟peakeasy.鈥  Exceptionally good cocktails, fine bar snacks, and super service.  To illustrate: the bar snack we ordered was a bit too highly seasoned for my companion.  So the server arranged for the kitchen to produce another version of the dish without the spice!  Amazing!  I shall return to Harold Black!"
5,3,5,5,"Very cool speakeasy, enjoyed myself thoroughly and it was a huge plus for my date (who is a bartender) who said that she loved it. Earned me bonus points for finding such a cool bar."
5,5,5,5,"Awesome cocktails, delicious lemon-artichoke hummus (I鈥檒l be back for the chocolate cake) and flawless service. The bartendress was very engaging and made us feel most welcome. We had such a great time that we had to reminded to leave after 3 hours to let the next reservation come in ;)"
5,4,5,5,Great date spot.
4,4,3,5,The place is pretty sweet and has the speakeasy vibe.  The drinks are great and the menu is small but the food is good.  The service is odd because there is only one bartender servicing the entire restaurant.
3,3,1,3,"I've dined downstairs at Aqua al 2 many times and was really excited to try Harold Black, finally getting a reservation after trying on several different occasions. I had a party of 4 and we were  seated in a small booth, which was uncomfortable for 2 of the individuals with me. I noticed there was an empty large round circular table. I went to ask the host politely if we could change to a different table. He responded saying that it wouldn't be possible, there already was a reservation. I would have been fine with this until he responded with ""There's 4 of you, correct? You'll be fine"" in a very rude tone. In about 30 more minutes, guess who was sitting at the large table - a party of 4! Super disappointed I spent my money here, my guests and I only stayed for 1 round as opposed to a few."
5,5,5,5,"We were seated early for our reservation, the bartender was very nice and an excellent mixologist. Great evening, and we definitely plan to return with friends."
5,5,5,5,Drinks! Spectacularly crafted cocktails in perfect ambiance.  Great music and great staff.
5,5,5,5,"Last minute booking to meet a friend mid week. She鈥檚 vegetarian, I鈥檓 not - menu had more than enough to satisfy both tastes.Service was excellent and dining experience overall was first rate."
4,4,4,4,"Harold Black is always a fun time! We loved our drinks-- both the cocktails and wine were excellent. We were greeting and seated promptly, which was great. But we were seated at the bar, which I didn't expect. So, even with a reservation, bar seating might be where they put you. I guess tables aren't guaranteed. And the crowd there was unusually loud, so it was a less quiet, romantic ambiance than normal."
5,5,5,4,Great place for an intimate date!
5,4,5,5,Very cool place to chill with friends or for a cozy date. Bartenders were very knowledgeable and offered exquisite craft cocktails. Definitely a no brainer for return visit.
5,5,5,5,Terrific! I have a thing for speakeasies and Harold Black's near the top of the list!
5,5,5,5,"Harold Black is always solid.  Dark, intimate, and a bit away from the touristy crowd, it's a great escape in DC.  The last few times I went, it seemed that the tourists might have found it, but this time it was mostly locals.  Had a quiet drink with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I didn't get to sit at the bar, which is sad, because watching the bartenders make the cocktails is half the experience.  Still, my drink was light and refreshing (if a little sweet), the atmosphere was chill, and I very much enjoyed my experience.  Definitely will return."
1,1,1,1,"We booked this for my birthday based on the raving reviews and indicated that on the reservation.  We arrived and were greeted 鈥榮ternly鈥 and assumed it鈥檚 part of the Speakeasy experience.  Once seated, we noticed how dark the place was and thought it鈥檚 also part of the charm.We were handled two menus and were keen to start as we were famished.  There was a candle on the bar stool where we sat but we couldn鈥檛 read the menu items.  I turned on my phone flashlight and the host who sat us rushed over saying that I should turn it off immediately as it鈥檚 disruptive to the experience.  I complied and could see why this would be the case.  I told him that we still had a problem reading the menus.  He then brought another candle.  There were two of us and we tried very hard but you couldn鈥檛 see the menus.  I informed the host that we still were unable to read the menus and asked him for help.  Je just went quite and then told me again that we cannot use a flashlight.  I agreed fully but said that we still have a problem because we can鈥檛 read the items.  Is there anything else that can be done ?  He basically indicated that there isn鈥檛.  When I said that I couldn鈥檛 see how this would work out, he opened the exit door for us to leave and went about doing something else.All in all, terrible experience.  Am happy for those who seem to have enjoyed this establishment and given it high ratings.  I cannot fathom why but I guess it takes all kinds to make the world.  I would never go back or recommend this for anyone. Also, for full disclosure, am considered somewhat of a foodie and enjoy eating in world restaurants almost daily but this is the first such review that I write.Not to be repeated."
5,5,4,5,"Everything was amazing! The Brussels are fantastic and the meat and cheese are to die for. One of my favorite places in DC. Only one small thing - would have preferred we were aware of time constraints of having a table. Totally understand it, just would have been nice to know in advance for a bigger group."
5,4,4,5,Great environment for good conversation
5,5,5,5,"Cool speakeasy, first time we went.  We decided to have a drink here before eating at Acqua Al 2.  Reservations highly recommended, there was a line when we left.  My wife and I sat at the bar and had drinks that were great - the bartender was fun to watch and very engaging to talk to.  My wife told him the types of things she likes and he made an amazing drink.   I had one off the menu that was very unusual and tasty.  We did not try the food.  We will definitely go back and take friends next time."
5,5,5,5,One of the best places I鈥檝e ever been too. Those lamb chops were amazing too! Wow! Great drinks and award winning service
5,3,5,5,"Love this place - great drinks, great service! My friend and I even got some mixology tips."
5,5,5,5,"Atmosphere dark and quiet like you鈥檇 expect. We only had the cheese board for food, but it was awesome! The mixed drinks are pricey, but worth it. Made with fresh ingredients. Bartenders very friendly and accommodating. Only disappointment was not getting a booth seat with reservation. We sat at bar. To be fair after booking they do tell you no guarantee for table. FYI it鈥檚 a cashless establishment."
4,4,4,4,Very cool spot! Will most definitely return and with friends!
5,5,5,5,Fabulous atmosphere and the drinks lived up to all that i had heard.  Wonderful!!
5,5,5,4,Husbands Birthday!
2,5,1,4,"I'll begin this review by saying that I had been looking forward to, and tried to find an occasion to visit Heirloom Cafe for a very long time. I've lived in San Francisco now for a year and have had dozens of dining recommendations, but I found this one on my own and was excited to visit a local gem in my neighborhood of the Mission. When one of my hometown friends visited, I wanted to bring her, and my local friend in SF for a ladies' dinner on a Saturday night. The food - delicious, presentable, a great portion. We had the fettucine and salmon and both were divine. The wine selection - abundant, knowledgeable, perfectly dry white and ros茅 to our taste preferences. The ambiance - candlelit, dim, great for close colleagues, friends, or a date. What completely turned us off however, was one of the servers.1. She seemed to be under the influence. Her words were slurred, and she approached our table in jerky movements.2. Our third guest arrived a bit after us, and about a minute after sitting down, the server came to our table and said ""What's the gameplan"" without asking to see if she had a chance to review the menu and decide  3. She accidentally knocked over the entire water decanter onto my friend's seating area, lap, and jacket. she didn't apologize but instead said ""it can be refreshing"". she continued to wipe it while not noticing that she was carrying 2 more decanters in her arm that continued to pour out - luckily a few other servers came to dry up the area 4. We left a nominal tip instead, and she came to the table while we were sitting there, stared closely at the receipt, and marched away to show her manager. Heirloom cafe: your other servers, from what we could tell, seemed to provide good service. We also spoke a few times to who we believe might be an owner and he was great. You should re-consider this server that has left an incredibly bad taste in our mouths and we will not be returning, nor recommending it."
5,5,5,5,"We introduced our friends and neighbors to Heirloom the other night. They were very impressed with the menu and presentation and overall excellent repast! I am certain they will be back to experience the restaurant again.  We, of course, visit as frequently as we are able. Thank you - Heirloom crew - for always providing a terrific dinner for us and our family."
5,5,5,5,Great neighborhood restaurant. We had the halibut ceviche and the pod salad.  Entrees were the Salmon and steak babette. Added the oatmeal chocolate cookie and bitter sweet chocolate budino.
5,5,5,5,"Low key and excellent, fresh food. Service was also excellent! Can鈥檛 wait to go back!"
4,4,4,4,"I ordered the halibut ceviche and the bean salad while my partner ordered the chicken with corn salsa looking thing...the bean salad was exceptional. His chicken was good but too salty. Overall, a solid B+.  My ceviche had some big pieces of fish and when I pointed it out, the waitress said that is the way the chef likes it...Duh...I was not born yesterday and I do know how to make better ceviche.   And the waitress was either drunk or high on something the way she moved...not cool for her or the restaurant."
5,5,5,5,Service was excellent - friendly and knowledgeable- made good recommendations.
5,5,5,3,"We had a wonderful dinner and service was spot on. Bacon and onion tart was flakey crust and perfectly seasoned topping. Salad pulled from the prix fixe menu was refreshing and had some unexpected ingredients, probably listed on the menu but forgotten in the interim. Roasted king salmon with veggies was delicious but tr茅s petite. And dessert of berries with polenta cake was tip top. Loved the French-sourced sauvignon blanc. Restaurant was loud but it's hard these days to find one conducive to conversation where cuisine holds no surprises, however well prepared it may be."
5,5,5,5,We love eating at heirloom the people the food it鈥檚 all outstanding!!!
3,3,5,3,We were disappointed.  Portions were very small.  Overpriced.  Noise terrible.
4,5,4,4,"Heirloom brings a sophistication to comfort food that makes it a great weeknight choice. A summer evening with corn chowder and the (off-menu) burger is a delight.  Service is friendly and attentive.  Tables are a bit tight, and noise can be a bit of a distraction, particularly when seated next to a couple of folks convinced they are about to conquer the world.   While not regulars, we have returned to Heirloom regularly over the years and never been disappointed."
5,5,5,5,Best servers. I want to be friends with them. Food is always on point.
5,5,5,5,Always very special hospitality. Fantastic wine list!
4,3,3,4,The  succotash was tasty but the chicken was very dry and not good
5,5,5,4,We loved the Heirloom Cafe! The food was excellent. Our waiter was so nice to us. We thought he was exceptionally so. We would definitely return but it would be a special occasion destination for us considering the cost.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing, always great. A little pricey, but nothing out of the ordinary for SF. Enjoy!"
5,5,5,4,Lovely food snd lovely service
5,5,5,5,Excellent food! Great service! It was noisy and hard to have a quiet conversation.
2,4,1,2,A waiter that wasn鈥檛 present and pretty incompetent and since the restaurant was loud could hardly hear what he was saying. He spoke so softly. And didn鈥檛 seem to have a knowledge of the menu. Also not a lot of personality or attention to our table.
5,5,5,5,Went to dinner after a show; the food was SO delicious and what wonderful service. Have come to Heirloom Cafe several times and have never been disappointed.
5,5,5,4,"As always, great dinner."
4,4,5,3,"Very good food; generous portions.  Matt, the owner is a pure delight and the wait staff was excellent.  Wish it wasn鈥檛 so noisy for us seniors ."
5,5,5,5,Mussels were so good that I ordered it twice!
5,5,5,5,"I love Heirloom Cafe and don鈥檛 dine here often enough.  The neighborhood feel, friendliness and competence of the staff, and the sumptuous authentic food keep Heirloom at the top of my list!"
3,3,3,5,The waitstaff was underwhelmed to see me and I them. The burger and salads were quite tasty but the fettuccine was undercooked. Plates were small and not elevated enough to be worth the price. I can鈥檛 recommend this restaurant.
5,5,5,5,"I really enjoyed my overall experience at Heirloom Cafe and would be somewhere that I return. All the dishes were quite tasty and incorporated flavors that you can't just simply make at home. Nothing was too salty or bland. The wine suggested was superb and paired well with the food. The waitress was warm, funny, sweet. The ambiance was cozy and romantic (dim lit with candles, wooden tables)."
5,5,5,5,Food and service was simply fantastic. It has an old feel with modern food. Felt like a great modern community feel.
5,5,5,4,We had a number of guests in our group of 8 with specific dietary needs. The staff went above and beyond. Highly recommend. They even have a large table that easily fits parties of 12 which a real find in the city.
5,5,5,5,"Heirloom Cafe is the best. Food, wine and service are top of the top. Love it."
5,5,5,5,"Dining at Heirloom is one of the great pleasures of living in the Mission -- or of visiting it.  Once the most tagged corner in the neighborhood, this sweet little spot now serves fresh, beautiful food with a simple, elegant aesthetic.  The staff is lovely and the meals are beautifully prepared.  The seasonal menu is complemented by a thoughtfully composed wine list -- and to say the atmosphere is charming doesn't begin do it justice.  Behind the gauzy curtains, the hubbub of the City fades away in a grand, open room that quickly fills with a pleasant crowd of diners who've dressed a bit for the occasion, and whose convivial conversations punctuate what always turns into a memorable night.  Even if we didn't live on the same block, we'd love it just as much as we already do!"
5,5,4,5,Great place before a show(Beautiful- Carol King). fun art deco vibe and bar drinks. meal was superb. parked a couple blocks away and had to negotiate sketchy street scene but worth it once arriving.  amazing kale salad!  will return.
5,5,5,4,"Great place that's reasonably priced for the quality of food. Not a lot of selection, but everything was delicious. The wine paring is great with pre-fix menu."
5,5,4,4,"Delightful neighborhood spot for celebrating our anniversary. The food and wine were exceptional. The house made fettuccini is a must order (I don't even like mushrooms and this was a standout dish). They also let you share a single order of the prix fixe which is a fantastic deal as it includes generous individual pours and the perfect amount of food to share when you add in an entree. We were both full, but not uncomfortably so. There's no way we could have eaten more! Especially pleased with how perfectly the wine complemented the food (really smart pairings) and how we got to try wines we wouldn't have otherwise known anything about. Will definitely recommend Heirloom to friends and family and look forward to the next occasion that brings us back here."
5,5,5,5,The food and service were absolutely solid. I eat here fairly often and have had almost no misses. This time I brought a friend with me who had never eaten at Heirloom - he was impressed!
4,5,4,5,"Lovely, per usual. Beautiful setting and the food is always simple but perfect."
5,5,5,3,Great service Delicious food
5,5,5,4,This was our first time dining here and really enjoyed a midweek birthday dinner. Service was so warm and welcoming and every dish was delish! Looking forward to a return visit soon.
5,4,5,4,Nice restaurant. Good service from quality people. Excellent wine list.  Could use a broader menu selection.
4,5,5,4,"Neighborhood gem, but timing was a bit off. We were served our dishes randomly so no one ate together. They were aware, and apologetic. I鈥檓 sure it was just one of those things that happen. Great place otherwise. Wine menu is fabulous. Highly recommend."
4,3,4,3,"Service was very good, we were seated promptly at our reservation time. Our server was warm and friendly. Background noise was quite loud which made it difficult to hear and the lighting was very dim. The food was beautifully presented but the tuna tartare was bland. The duck salad was slightly dry but had a nice flavor. The burger was definitely the tastiest. The wine was awesome and reasonably priced. Overall the experience was pleasant but with so many other places to choose from, I don't think we'll return anytime soon."
5,5,5,5,"When you walk in on a Wednesday night and the place is full, you know it鈥檚 good!!"
5,5,5,5,Can鈥檛 get enough of that wood fired pizza! The pumpkin app was delicious and we were excited to have made it for happy hour drinks!
5,5,5,5,"Excellent dinner as always!  Service was great, and food was outstanding."
4,5,4,4,"The menu changes daily. We decided to split the chopped salad which was delicious.  We each ordered a pizza, one with various meats and the other, mushroom. The pizza was tasty, thin crust but a little bit too oily for my taste (mushroom). Had I known, I would have asked that they hold on adding oil.  The server was excellent.  She checked back often and it was clear that they wanted us to be happy."
5,5,5,5,"Our server didn't write our order down and ended up forgetting two items, but we didn't care because we love Hersh's so much! The menu changes with the seasons and everything was delicious!"
4,5,3,3,Service was a little slow but food was incredible!
5,5,5,5,Great food and good atmosphere!
5,5,5,5,One of my favorite restaurants in South Baltimore. Great food - small menu means they focus on making a few dishes really really well. The homemade pastas are incredible especially the smoky cheesy carbonara. Pumpkin appetizer was creative and tasty on the first crisp evening of fall. Nice wine list. Great servers - knowledgeable and really friendly. Outdoor seating is a plus! Highly recommend.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful dining experience.
5,5,5,5,"Love love love Hersh鈥檚. Great food, friendly staff, and a real neighborhood gem."
5,5,5,5,Great food and the service was friendly and attentive. Very cool neighborhood vibe.
5,4,5,4,"Nice, casual restaurant.  They seemed to really care about the quality of the food and service.  Everything was delicious."
4,4,4,4,Wonderful food !! And fun atmosphere 鉂わ笍 wish they had more vegetarian pasta options ...
4,5,3,4,"Great food! Was a little disappointed they didn鈥檛 ask us if we wanted to sit outside since it was a great weather. Usually they sit families with kids upstairs which is fine, but on a nice day we would have loved the option to sit outside. Waitress had a few flubs with our pizza order and the check but not a big deal, she was sweet and made all corrections with a smile and apology."
5,5,5,5,"Hersh鈥檚 is incredible. Their food is outstanding, and the service is impeccable."
5,5,5,5,"This is my favorite place in Baltimore, err- on earth."
5,5,4,5,Excellent pasta - ravioli and spaghetti. Excellent octopus app. Excellent crab pancake app. Will definitely return.
5,5,5,5,Delish food. Great value priced wines.
5,5,5,4,Great food as always.
5,5,5,5,"Meals made of perfection!  This is a hidden gem for sure. The meals are like no other, homemade food from scratch. I really can鈥檛 get enough of this place. Leaves you wanting to eat there permanently."
5,5,5,5,They never miss. Hersh's for the win all day e'ry day馃弳
5,5,5,5,Pizza was delicious!!
5,5,5,5,"Chef Josh Hershvoitz serves up awesome brick-oven pizza and homemade pasta in a lively bar/restaurant in this South Baltimore neighborhood gem. Friendly staff, great cocktails and wine list reasonably priced. One of our favorites!"
5,5,5,5,Our always fave go to Bmore restaurant. It鈥檚 always innovative food with a friendly neighborhood vibe.
5,5,5,5,Our favorite place! Great food and laid back ambiance! fun cocktails!
5,4,4,3,The house-made pastas are fantastic! I would highly recommend a meal at Hersh鈥檚.
5,5,5,5,Great service and food for a birthday dinner!
5,5,5,5,"Always fresh, always local, always seasonal, always delicious!"
5,5,5,4,We love Hersh鈥檚. Excellent food & service. Very welcoming staff. Warm atmosphere.
5,5,5,5,Everything was amazing as always!! Especially enjoyed the Squid Ink Tagliolini!!
5,5,5,5,Excellent as always
5,5,5,5,Our favorite restaurant in Baltimore. Never disappoints!
5,5,5,5,Terrific fresh locally sourced food. Meatballs are always the best compared to any other restaurant. Allie鈥檚 wonderful behind the bar & consistently makes us feel at home.
5,5,4,4,Hersh鈥檚 rarely disappoints and Wednesday was even better than usual. Food was excellent. The menu descriptions don鈥檛 do justice to the actual food. Also I asked the chef to sub out the rice pilaf for green beans and he literally grilled them in the wood fire -SO SO delicious! My only complaint is they are always out of something on the menu I want to try!
4,5,4,5,"Delicious pasta dishes  in a nice, intimate atmosphere"
5,5,5,5,We sat outside so it was nice and quiet.
5,5,5,5,"I am so unbelievably fortunate that I live just one block from Hersh's. It makes it easier and more convenient to stuff my gob with their delicious inventive food and pour their amazing libations down my throat. I went on #NationalFriedChickenDay and was blown away by their fried chicken meal. Run, don't walk, when fried chicken is on the menu."
5,5,5,5,"Best veggie apps, pizza and killer customerr service in Baltimore!"
5,5,5,5,"Perfect as usual. Hersh's is consistently good, all the time. And because the menu changes, I am constantly finding new things to try that are always ridiculously delicious (and the best things I ever ate). The fettuccini thats on the menu right now is one of the best pasta dishes they've ever made, but literally everything on the menu is amazing.  I also love their quaint outdoor patio - I always prefer to eat outside during the summer and this patio does not disappoint. Easily one of my favorite restaurants in the city!!"
5,5,5,5,Our server was one of the best.  She was awesome.  Very attentive.  Very social and friendly without intruding.
5,5,5,5,Best romantic I ever had with my wife. It was everything I imagined it to be and more.
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful ambience. Impeccable service , fabulous food!"
5,5,5,5,Foods and services at this restaurant are excellent.  Very nice and cozy decoration.  Highly recommended!
4,4,4,5,"The atmosphere is exceptional.  The food portions were perfect.  There were several offerings compliments of the chef.  We consider ourselves foodies and have dined inside and outside the U.S.   The chef鈥檚 selections were delicious.  However, the price for the dining experience, especially the wine pricing was unnecessarily exorbitant.  The wine we ordered was $40 per glass or the wine pairing was $170.  These prices could not be justified.  It was a once in a lifetime experience and not to be repeated."
5,5,5,4,Sommelier and waiter we're fantastic. Met chef O'Connell when asked. Great experience and food.
4,0,0,0,"We visited the Inn last night for our 5th wedding anniversary. This was our first time at the Inn and we appreciate the opportunity. I am going to be honest with my review and please keep in mind that this is my personal opinion. It might sound nitpicky but I think that you earn the right to nitpick if you shell out this amount of money for food :)I have been to one other restaurant with a similar structure and that is Marcel's by Robert Wiedmaier in DC. We went there for our 1st wedding anniversary so I will compare both restaurants.The quality of the cuisine is similar at both restaurants and there is very little that sets them apart. The wine pairing and selections was outstanding at both restaurants. Marcel's provided multiple ""entremets"" between courses and the Inn did not do so. When it comes to table service, the only area where the Inn performed better than Marcel's was the enthusiasm and interaction we received from the waiter, Andrew. However, the waiter at Marcel's was still very good. He performed all his table service at a higher level of technical service. The table was cleaned thoroughly and properly in between courses by Marcel's while at the Inn the table was just not cleaned and cleared properly. The waiter at the table next to us dropped used utensils on a customer which is a massive offense for a 3 star restaurant. Additionally, the sommelier at the Inn poured the incorrect for the wine pairing at dessert. While the experience at both restaurants was very good, Marcel's provided a slightly better dining experience. We certainly did not leave hungry from the Inn and are glad to have the opportunity to dine at an acclaimed restaurant, we think that these little things are worth noting when dining at a restaurant of this level."
5,5,5,5,This restaurant is a true gem.  The quality of everything is amazing.  A good place to splurge on a special occasion.  But you must make reservations as far in advance as possible.
5,5,5,5,"Our evening at the Inn at Little Washington was exceptional! They made my husband's birthday feel so special. The food, service, and ambiance were all delightful and memorable. Every dish was perfectly composed and delicious. Service was perfect, we never wanted for anything but were left alone so we can carry on a conversation. Everything felt intimate, romantic, and serene. The highlight was being able to see the kitchen and meet Chef O'Connell. My only small criticism is with the wine pairings. I didn't love a lot of the selections and especially did not like the Riesling. It was so sweet I didn't even drink it. The server who was pouring the wines noticed and commented on my full glass yet never offered a replacement pairing which I would have appreciated."
4,0,0,0,Interesting place and very odd staff.  Food is excellent.
5,5,5,5,From the moment we arrived until we left this was a unique and incredible dining experience. Food and service are impeccable. Thank you for a great experience both dining and lodging. We will be back.
5,4,5,5,Delicious food although a tad inconsistent. We also had to wait wayyyy too long for the cheese and dessert course. To their credit they comped the cheese course.
4,5,4,5,Birthday & Anniversary
5,5,5,5,"The best meal of our lives. The food is worth  a trip from any corner of the globe. Wine lovers are better off pulling a gem from their cellar rather than the pairings which, while varied, were somewhat pedestrian."
5,5,5,5,"From the moment we crossed the street and were greeted with an dapper seer-sucker dressed man with an umbrella, to the moment we left, with all staff wishing us farewell, it was an amazing experience. Thank you for making our first anniversary as special as it felt. Keep up the excellent work!"
5,5,5,5,"The experience was exquisite replete with visual beauty, heavenly aromas, in captivating textures and blissful flavors. This is the best dining experience in the New World. Thank you for the memories!"
3,4,3,4,"Disappointing, considering it is a three star Michelin restaurant."
5,5,5,5,No words can describe how wonderful our visit was...every little details were tended to from the beginning to the ending of our meal. We will have to come up with more reasons to celebrate at the Inn...soon!!!!
5,5,5,5,"Splendid experience, as I had expected."
5,5,5,5,Best meal ever!  Elegance around every corner.
5,5,5,5,"We had an extraordinary time at the Inn at Little Washington! The server Jessie was wonderful, and made great beverage recommendations. All of the little details!! Customized menus, goodie box of treats to go. It was unbelievable. Each course was amazing and flavorful. They were extremely accommodating to my gluten free dietary restriction. 10/10 would recommend going here for a special occasion."
5,5,5,5,What can I say about dining here that hasn't already been said. I'm always afraid that I'm hyping this place so much that those who join me will be let down but the Inn consistently exceeds my expectations and those of my guests. I cannot get enough of Cameron and the Moo Cow cheese cart. He is the maestro of cheesy humor. I'll be back again and again.
5,5,5,5,"Creative, perfectly seasoned food paired with excellent service."
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic experience from start to finish.  Amazing food, wine pairings, and staff."
5,5,5,5,"A wonderful time was had by all. The food was delicious and the staff was wonderful. A celebration of birthdays was made even more special by a wonderful and attentive staff. The young man at the front door who welcomed us and parked my car, the welcoming hostess who showed us to our table, Chris who oversaw our dinning experience, the wine expert who suggested a fine bottle of wine, and everyone else who had a hand in bringing food and drink, they all made the experience special. We were seated in an area with five other couples which made for an intimate dinning experience. It was really nice, it made you feel special with all the attention and care.It was really wonderful."
5,5,5,5,World class!
5,5,5,5,Beautiful experience! The food was beyond amazing. Words do not do it justice.
5,5,5,5,It was our 31st Anniversary dinner.  A once in a lifetime dining experience.
5,5,5,5,"Everything was wonderful.  The food, the wine pairing, the explanations, the cheese cart! This was my partner's 60th birthday and they created a keepsake menu.  I had called ahead and paid for a copy of the cookbook and it was waiting for him.  Lovely evening in every way."
5,5,5,5,Five stars all around. There鈥檚 a reason this is a three Michelin star restaurant! Absolutely the finest dining ever! Patrick O鈥機onnel is a genius!
5,5,5,5,"The Inn at Little Washington is a world class experience in every way. It doesn鈥檛 get any better. We are so fortunate to have it in our backyard. It鈥檚 worth the trip it every time, no matter how far you are traveling to get there!"
3,3,5,4,"Its a very nice place but just not a good value. For what it cost it should blow your mind and for me it just didn't. To be fair, its not really my kind of experience. That said, I have been to some highly rated and very pricey restaurants around DC. i.e. Bourboun Steak, Bond 45 and others and was much more satisfied. The service is top notch of course I will give it 5 stars there. But negatives were the seating is close quarters; we were sandwiched a foot away from tables on each side of us and more than once an obnoxious woman next to us jumped into our conversation univited.  Food was good but not mind blowing by any means. Not exactly what I expected for a dinner for 2 at about $750."
5,5,5,5,"Everything from valet service, to meal service, to quality... all excellent! Staff made us feel like family for our Easter gathering. The selection of menus provided excellent choices for each of us. The wine pairings were spot on 鈥攁nd each wine was described in detail, as were the menu items. I really love this place and will go back as often as I can!"
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic. This is a jewel.  It has been 20 years since our last visit. We decided it鈥檚 worth a visit a couple of times a year. On the way out we were greeted by Luray, the owners Dalmatian. What a treat."
5,5,5,5,"Truly deserves our 6hr drive from NY to enjoy the 5 course meal at The inn at Little Washington. Every service staff from the door man hold the umbrella when we got out of the car to our server and sommelier, and the manager who kindly gave us a kitchen tour are all fabulous. Food was fantastic, truly an amazing experience."
5,5,5,5,"The Inn is always consistent鈥攁mazing food, creative presentation, excellent service. Always lives up to our expectations and never disappoints."
5,5,5,5,"Cannot find a better location for comfort, ambiance, great food, and attentive staff.  Can't wait to return."
5,5,5,5,Worth the hype. Worth the money. Just do yourself a favor and go!
3,4,4,5,"Overall the food and experience was good. TLDR is, it's not worth the price, and DO NOT get the wine pairing. Wine pairing was $170/person. It didn't add anything to the dishes, and you only got 2.5 glasses. Getting a cocktail instead of the wine would have saved us at least $200, and would have had the same food experience. Not only did the wine not add to the food experience, but some were just bad. Some of the dishes were amazing, but for those prices I was expecting every dish to blow me away. Can get similar food/experience for 1/4th the price at nice D.C. restaurants. Portions were small, which is to be expected. But when the tasting menu works out to about $60/dish (before tax and tip) you expect more than one scallop."
5,5,5,5,"Simply outstanding.  Dining at The Inn at Little Washington is a life experience.  It's not for the shy of pallet nor wallet, but that should be expected for a restaurant with _three_ Michelin Stars. The service is exceptional and extremely accommodating; ask and it shall be provided.Plan for as much as three hours for your dining visit.  Lots of courses and many little extra offerings in between.  Dress your best and take your special person for the night of their life."
4,4,5,5,"Delicious and very good but not one of the best meals I鈥檝e ever had. Not necessarily worth the price we paid, but a great experience.  Worth it as a bucket list thing.  The ambience and the service were impeccable."
5,5,5,5,We went to celebrate my birthday.  Our server Dave made our experience awesome.  Food was amazing.
5,5,5,5,"Scott, behind  the bar made the evening. Made us feel welcomed. We were running 10 minutes late ( 8.00pm reservations).and called prior to that to let restaurant know we were running late and were told they would try to accommodate us if possible. Needed up at bar with full menus and fabulous service. Blessing in disguise."
5,5,5,5,Everything was great from appetizers to dessert. Joes never disappoints ! Service was great as well!
5,4,5,4,Great steaks great salads the sides could be improved
3,3,3,3,Food came out slow.  Waited 30-45 minutes for our food to come out.  It was a Busy Sat night.  Always had a good experience at Joes but this time the steaks were dry and tough and sides weren鈥檛 very appealing.  They have to do better Quality control.
5,5,5,5,Everything was so great. Food and service was amazing.
5,5,5,5,Have visited Joe鈥檚 on several occasions and we never have been disappointed.
5,5,5,5,Everything was great!
5,5,5,5,"Always top-notch food, ambiance and service!  My husband loves it for the stone crab.  I think they have the best crab bisque I've ever had.  Such a treat to go there!"
5,5,5,3,Our waitress was amazing
5,5,5,5,Wonderful food and service was outstanding!
5,5,5,5,I had the 12 oz. Filet and it ranks as one of the top 3 best steaks I've ever had in my life. Also the fried asparagus and mac n cheese were very good. We live 3 hours away but definitely will be back.
5,5,5,4,Service was great and so was the food. Joes never disappoints
5,5,5,5,"We dines at Joes approx. 4-5 times a yr, never had a bad experience. The food is great, the service is always excellent."
5,5,5,5,Couldn鈥檛 have been better.
5,5,5,5,"sooooo soooo fun, such a good meal , such good presentation and staff is the best. always premium, thanks joes!!!"
5,5,5,5,"We have been to Joe鈥檚 several times, always for special occasions. This time we celebrated our twins 40th Birthday. We always have a wonderful time with our children and their spouses, but our Special Server-Denice Storey brought our level of enjoyment to an exceptional place. I know it is her job to make your customers feel welcome, but she made us feel part of the Joe鈥檚 family. She recommended wonderful wines and sides to go with the meals we ordered. She brought us four amazing desserts to end our evening. We never felt rushed-we just enjoyed! Thank you so much for another special evening and thank you for having Denice as our server!!"
5,5,5,5,Fabulous dinner
5,4,5,4,"We had a wonderful experience.  Our server was excellent/plus, and although we4 pretty much stuck to our usual menu choices, everything was delicious.  We weren't given the table we had requested bc it was unavailable, but we sat at Table 10 and it was quiet and lovely.  We will add it to our list of preferred tables at Joes."
5,5,5,5,The food and service were second to none! Will be back!
5,5,5,5,Birthday celebration for my best friend and we wanted a fantastic meal. Joe鈥檚 staff was exquisite as was the food. Each bite was an experience.
5,5,5,5,Our server was fantastic and the food was superb! The dinner at Joe鈥檚 was a highlight of our girl鈥檚 trip to Chicago!!
5,5,5,3,Great service and good. Crab Legs are always outstanding.
5,5,5,5,Worth the price great service and atmosphere can't wait to go back.
5,5,5,5,Professional and courteous staff! Food was excellent. We had the filet mignon bone in and it was great!
5,5,5,5,It lived up to the hype. The Stone Crabs were awesome. We at a bit too late for my liking but it was very good.
3,5,4,3,Tables were to close together which made the restaurant too load.  Overheard many other conversations from our table
5,5,5,5,The staff were so friendly and helpful and had great recommendations. The food was amazing!!!! Service was brilliant too. Would definitely recommend a visit when in Chicago but would recommend booking in advance if you want a weekend booking.
5,5,5,5,"This was an incredible dining experience.  Our waitress, Denise, was extremely accommodating and knowledgeable.  The stuffed shrimp was yummy and key lime pie was the perfect ending. Can't wait to go again!!"
5,5,5,4,The food was great as always and our waiter was exceptional
5,5,5,5,Excellent food. Tried the filet Oscar with bearnaise sauce and it was delicious. Came on our anniversary and had complimentary champagne to celebrate. Will always come back to great food + service!
5,5,5,5,Excellent on every level!
5,5,4,5,As always the food and the ambiance was fantastic. The bone in Filet was great.
5,5,5,5,As always excellent food and service!
5,5,5,5,"From the minute we walked in and was greeted by the Host our journey begin with excellence and ended in the same manner.  I took my brother for a early dinner to celebrate his birthday. A birthday tradition we started over 35 years ago.  This was a very special celebration because for the first time our sister was not with us. She passed away a year ago. We laughed, cried and reminisced  and  enjoyed each other so much.  Days later my brother is still talking about the wonderful experience at Joe鈥檚.  He wants to do it again at Joe鈥檚.  Joe鈥檚 - mission accomplished!"
5,5,5,5,Fue una cena extraordinaria entre amigos en un ambiente magn铆fico donde todos quedaron fascinados con el nivel de cocina que tiene el lugar
5,5,5,5,Great ambiance and service.
5,5,5,5,"Enjoyed this great meal ..just fantastic , great food great place"
5,5,5,5,We went  there twice while we are staying in Chicago.We really wanted to eat Stone Crab.It was sooo ono (delicious)and Pumpkin pie was incredible very light taste.Waiter was also a nice person.We recommend every thing.
2,3,4,3,I don鈥檛 know what all of the hype is about this place . It was ok. I mean there are plenty of other better restaurants in Chicago.
5,5,5,4,Great foods and exceptional wine selection. I will definitely come back again.
5,5,5,5,"What a spectacular dinner.  We dined on a Saturday after having eaten at two Chef's tasting menus during the prior two nights (Per Se and Babbo).  Jungsik destroyed the competition with artful and creative dishes.  The amuse bouche was so incredible that we begged for and received a second round of them prior to dessert.  While not inexpensive, the meal was worth every penny."
5,5,5,5,Amazing experience. Our server was also phenomenal.
5,5,5,5,The signature tasting was phenomenal!!! Impressed me and my foodie guests. One of the best meals I鈥檝e had in NYC
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic!  The chef and the team incorporated Korean flavors into each dish and enhanced the experience that no other restaurant could.  Probably similar to others, my favorite were foie gras dumplings, wagu kalbi, and kimbap.  Four gras dumpling dish was especially good because of the broth.  And how did they make the octopus so crispy, and so tender at the same time?  My least favorite was the grill branzino, it had nice crispy skin, but didn't quiet matched with other dishes.  I also have to give the pastry chef a high praise for her inventive ""banana"" which is so clever, but I love the fact that the desserts weren't overly sweet, they were all well balanced.  I would highly recommend the restaurant, maybe even above EMP or Per Se.  The dining room isn't as grand as other 3 Michelin star restaurants, but  staff were all so attentive without being intrusive and worked well together.  Can't wait to go back to try their other menu."
5,5,5,5,Excellent!
5,5,5,5,This was amazing. Thank you Tim(jangnim)
5,5,5,5,Brilliant high end Korean with some French influences.  Great wine list including lovely Rieslings that pair well with the food.  Terrific service in an elegant room.
5,5,5,5,"Astounding service, food, wine and ambience. Once in a lifetime experience. The staff here is unparalleled in hospitality."
4,4,5,4,Great service and wine pairing.
5,5,5,5,"A truly splendid restaurant, among a small handful that should be considered the finest in New York. A graceful, tranquil environment, with food which is remarkable in its harmonious blend of flavors and beautiful and creative in its presentation. The staff is incredibly flexible in accommodating the most unusual dietary requests. Overall, a grand slam home run."
5,5,5,5,Birthday -was amazing in every way!!!
5,5,5,5,"From start to finish, Jungsik was a perfect meal   Had no idea until 3/4 of the way through our meal that this place has 2 Michelin stars   This was our first Korean omakase experience so did not know what to expect    We are accustomed to tasting menus and Japanese omakase   We were blown away by Jungsik   To say that we love Jungsik is an understatement   Run, don鈥檛 walk"
5,5,5,5,"We went for our anniversary. Team Tim took amazing care of us, and the food was amazing. First time experiencing Michelin Star Korean. Highly recommend! Very good wine list as well. Do it. You won鈥檛 be sorry."
5,4,5,5,"Love the service. The food was not as amazing as I have ever imagined, but the chef gave an additional dish, it was very kind."
5,5,5,5,Espectacukar!!
5,5,5,5,"Todo impresionante, un pulpo como antes no hab铆a probado, pero el postre del pl谩tano incre铆ble!!!"
5,5,5,5,Outstanding food. Refined and perfect executed.  The service is awesome also
5,5,5,5,Everything about Jungsik was amazing. The food was incredible. The mixed drinks and wine were excellent. The service was impeccable. It was a great experience and a memorable night. I look forward to going back soon!
5,5,5,5,"Wow! I am blown away by the food, service , and the overall ambiance. This was probably one of the best meal and dining experience in my life. I did not know Korean food could be expressed this way. As a fellow Korean, this was a very eye opening experience. I hope Jungsik receives a third star one day!"
5,5,5,5,everything was perfect!
5,5,5,5,Always great to be back here. Becoming my family鈥檚 regular joint whenever we are in NYC. Amazing food. Great service. The dessert is awesome too
5,5,5,5,Incredible experience every bite was better than the next. Impeccable service and a dessert tasting I'll never forget
5,5,5,5,Los alimentos son riqu铆simos
5,5,5,5,One of the best restaurant I鈥檝e been to. Everything was top notch and of the utmost quality. Will recommend everyone I know about this establishment.
5,5,5,5,It鈥檚 always a pleasure dining here. It鈥檚 a very classy establishment and great thought goes into the duration of their food and the attentiveness of the staff is impeccable.
5,5,5,5,Appetizer and dessert were very innovative! Service were good!
5,5,5,5,Amazing meal and service as always!
5,5,5,5,"Amazing amazing amazing! Everything was mind blowing, from the second you sit down and communicate with the host to every bite you take. Signature menu is truly the way to go to experience the culinary journey."
4,5,3,5,"Firstly, the food is good! But there is not good for celebrate special day! Because it鈥檚 too noisy! We are seated in a meeting room that there are two parties and another couples. I reserve the restaurant for my husband鈥檚 birthday, we most prefer delicious food and comfortable ambiance, but we are seated with a big party that talking loudly and laugh loudly, that鈥檚 too noisy! And every course coming too slow. We wait too long for finish per course. I don鈥檛 think we will come back and recommend. Sorry for that."
5,5,5,5,"Excellent Food, Presentation and Service."
5,5,5,5,"Our first experience at Jungsik was so extraordinary that we had to return again the following week..(yes, it was that good). We tried the seasonal menu this visit and in addition added some of our favorites..the octopus and tuna kimbap.Once again we had an incredible meal. Tim and George helped to make the evening perfect. Kudos to them!Looking forward to return soon to try the fall menu. Jungsik has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in NYC."
5,5,5,5,"High end Korean Restaurant with great ambient, delicious and exquisite food"
5,5,5,5,What a wonderful experience starting from the moment we entered the restaurant. Katherine and Oscar were our servers extraordinarie!  I cannot day enough about their professionalism and expertise. We ordered the signature tasting and added the Uni course for 2. The food was beautifully presented and prepared to perfection.. I cannot wait to return. That鈥檚 you for an amazing evening!
4,4,4,4,"it's my second time, the menu hasn't changed a lot. I would visit this place in future if chief has new ideas."
5,5,5,5,The best service I鈥檝e had in New York City
5,5,5,5,"Everything from the food, to the service is impeccable, Jungsik New York is as exquisite as it鈥檚 Seoul counterpart."
5,5,5,5,"This was a memorable meal, which began with the best Manhattan I've ever had, and I've had a few.  The Signature tasting menu was creative, varied, with unusual and fascinating combinations of flavors, textures, and presentations.  We chose the more costly wine pairing, which we shared.  One of the wines was a bit boring, the rest were quite remarkable.  Excellent service in a quiet, spacious, friendly room."
5,4,5,5,The food was ok but the service was really awesome.
5,5,5,5,The food was outstanding in quality and innovation.  The 'banana' was an amazing creation of beauty and deliciousness!
5,5,5,3,"Went here for an anniversary dinner a few weeks ago and it was a terrific experience.  We used to live in Manhattan and couldn't help comparing the experience to the likes of Le Bernardin, Babbo, etc.  It was definitely up there in all aspects- attention to detail, knowledgeable wait staff, perfect execution.  The actual dining room itself was okay but we were there for the food and I was definitely glad to be surrounded by 30+ age group diners."
5,5,5,5,A very special restaurant!
5,0,0,0,"kinship is a calming, soothing, elegant oasis where the food is taken seriously but the people are down to earth. it is a lovely dining experience."
5,5,5,5,"Our evening at Kinship ranks up there, with memorable dinners at the two or three top restaurants in the Washington, DC area.  Our visiting out-of-town friend, who regularly travels around the world (literally),was awed, as my spouse and I were, with the consistently superb quality of every dish, the perfection of preparation, and the elegance of presentation. All of this was enhanced by correctly recommended wines, highly professional service, and a ""classy"" ambiance. We can't wait to return!"
5,5,5,5,Food was great and service was exceptional
5,5,5,5,"The experience here was fantastic. Our server was knowledgeable, astute, and friendly. Food was all fantastic, and my boyfriend's drink was the ""best old fashioned he's ever had."" We had a small food allergy and they were more than accommodating about it. We will definitely come back for more special occasions!"
5,5,5,5,The food is simply exquisite.  We enjoyed the flavors of each dish very much.
5,5,5,5,Excellent service and very accommodating. We had a baby with us and they were more than willing to help in any way possible.
4,4,5,5,"I was pleased with my experience at Kinship, but I don't believe that I will be going back. I enjoyed about half of the dishes that we ordered, including the tuna appetizer, the grilled shoat, and the Vietnamese banana fritters. However, I was underwhelmed by some of the other dishes. I enjoyed going to Kinship as a one-time experience to check off the list, and I'd recommend it for adventurous eaters willing to take a chance and potentially be disappointed. Service was really amazing, and the ambiance is exquisite."
5,5,5,5,"Sam AND his barback/assistant WERE AWESOME!!! Had a great Sunday, we mentioned we would be back EVERY SUNDAY."
5,4,5,5,"Lovely, cozy setting with very attentive staff! Sunday dinner so we were all going for a lighter dinner, so order several apps to accompany a shared entree. Sea bass to share was lovely, came with roasted cauliflower, mini-porter house rolls. We enjoyed also the crispy taro root appetizer, too. We also enjoyed the Vietnamese banana fritters for dessert."
5,5,5,5,One of the best meals I've ever had! The Kinship chicken is a must.
5,5,5,5,"Remains one of the very top restaurants in DC.  Beautiful setting, great service, excellent wine and amazing food. And Chef Eric having red chile chimichurri on his menu?!  Definitely try the piri piri beef."
5,5,4,5,Great birthday experience with my boy friend. I will definitely be back again!
5,5,5,5,Birthday for wife
5,5,5,5,"Our waiter was incredible and the food was even better. Is it a bit pricey? Sure, but it's also worth every penny. The Chicken is as good as everyone says it is."
5,5,5,5,"A perfect dining experience.Food, service, ambiance...  5 stars"
5,5,5,5,"What I can say about Kinship is....... it all makes sense. From the walk through the door you are welcomed by people who care and want to make your experience an exceptional one. It was our anniversary so when sat at the table there was a card to congratulate us and I knew we were in for a great meal. The service is almost robotic in a way where it doesn鈥檛 seem fake but a gui帽e care for the customer. Food pace is perfectly executed while the service team replaces and replenishes your water, silverware, and bread. Food is being prepared in the back awaiting for the arrival.The food is just as amazing as the service. The sunchoke with Avocado and Aj铆 Dulce peppers is a must try. So is the quail. Entres of Duck confit and Braised Shoat shoulder really sent it over the top. Eating here you really understand and see what a great restaurant is about. The team here has all bought into the concept and work like clock work. It鈥檚 a pleasure to come here and I will continue to sing the praise of your team and your restaurant. Very well done Kinship! Thank you!"
5,5,5,5,Great server.
5,5,5,5,"Great good, great atmosphere, and great (very friendly) service. We鈥檒l be back."
5,5,5,5,Impeccable service with genial and well-trained staff. Food was incredible. Small plates with distinct flavor profiles that reflect the skill and talent of the chefs. Each waiter is also sommelier trained and had excellent wine recommendations with each course. Very accommodating with allergies (gluten free bread is unreal!) and thoughtful touches for birthdays. We are definitely coming back!!
5,5,5,5,Amazing!!!
4,4,4,4,the taste of food is a little bit heavy for us
4,4,5,5,"Celebrated Valentine鈥檚 Day dinner at Kinship.  The customer service was wonderful. The cocktails were great.   As for the food, am not sure if I am happy or disappointed.  I mean, it was great overall. However, comparing it to other fine dining restaurants and/or one starred Michelin starred restaurants, I don鈥檛 think they are at par with them.  For example, if I haven tried Marcel鈥檚 boudin blanc, I would say it鈥檚 great. But, I have to say Marcel鈥檚 is better.  And, I would stay away from their Moulard Duck Foi Gras Confit.  I love foi gras and never had a bad one. I have my favorites and not, but I would say theirs is the worst for me.  Overall, it鈥檚 a great restaurant. I just can鈥檛 say it鈥檚 the best one out there."
5,5,5,4,Food and service was excellent! Really enjoyed our dining experience.
5,5,5,5,I would absolutely and have already recommended Kinship to multiple friends and colleagues.
5,5,5,5,"Some of the best food I have had in DC, the menu was exceptional, the lobster french toast was out of this world, and the service and ambiance were something I would expect from a much more expensive restaurant. I would go back in a heartbeat, the staff decor and food were an experience unto themselves. Will recommend to anyone looking for an elevated food experience in DC"
5,4,5,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at kinship. The portion size was just right.  The quality of the scallops and the overall venison dish were superb. The Jerusalem artichokes and pommes anna were very tasty starters.  The 4/5 stars was because of the chocolate tart with lapsang souchong; very smoky taste.  Maybe others love it, but we found it a bit odd. Service was outstanding.  We will be back often."
3,3,3,2,"I specifically selected anniversary under special occasion when I made the booking, but nothing was done differently for the occasion. We found that surprising and disappointing, epecially the fact that the two tables next to us received cards, complimentary desserts and were wished a happy anniversary."
5,5,5,5,Very well taken care of and everything was timed out at a nice pace.
3,3,5,3,service was great - food was a little better than average given the price point.
5,5,5,4,"Incredible service, amazing innovative food, all-around fantastic experience. Top 3 must try...lobster french toast,  Maine scallops, chocolate souffle cake."
5,5,5,5,"This was our first time to kinship, but not our last. The menu is creative and organized in columns of ""style/feeling"" with a couple of starters, a couple of entr茅es, and a couple of desserts in each. The food was first-rate and well priced for the quality. There were a number of locally sourced meats and produce. The wine list was smart with a good variety. Especially noteworthy was the list of very good 375ml bottles."
5,5,5,5,Kinship is simply outstanding. Great place to celebrate a special occasion. The food and service are terrific. Can't wait to return.
5,5,5,5,Amazing and creative dishes with excellent service
5,5,5,5,"Excellent meal at Kinship. Service was polished, food was spectacular."
5,5,5,5,Fantastic experience. Service was amazing. Food was amazing. Just go.
5,5,5,5,Great meal!  Loved the lobster appetizer and roasted chicken.  Service perfect!  Thank you.  Ill be back soon.
5,5,5,5,Exceptional in every way though you can鈥檛 have the 4# chicken unless you can commit an extra 80 minutes to the cooking process. The sausage and cod were our second choices and they didn鈥檛 disappoint
5,5,5,5,"Truly enjoyed your unique dining experience.  Loved the booth we sat in for the 4 of us.  Food was fresh, flavorful, eclectic, right size portion, that allowed each of us to taste/enjoy each others dishes.  All of the staff was most helpful.  Recommendations for tasting multiple different dishes was great!"
4,5,4,4,Definitely consistent with sumptuous food and well crafted drinks.
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding on all levels, Zac was great, manager cares, food incredible, fab table, beautiful lighting, no noise. Can鈥檛 wait to go back."
5,5,5,5,Food was great vibe was incredible
5,5,5,5,"Our first time at this restaurant, a family get together, Promptly seated and given time to settle with drinks.... interesting cocktails, the three we tried were delicious, nice wine selection. The menu allows for shared plates, light eaters, and complete dinners. Loved their Lobster salad, miso soup, crispy rice with yellowtail tuna tartare. With six of us we had 8 share plates, 3 salads, 2 soups 3 appetizers and 4 dinners. We topped off dinner with dessert including after dinner drinks. The highlight was my 40 year old Gramm Port .... excellent.  Service was pleasant and timely. The food was soooo good I can鈥檛 wait to go again!"

5,5,5,5,The usual. They were perfect
5,5,5,5,Always have an amazing experience here! The staff is amazing!
5,5,5,5,Emily was fantastic
3,4,4,3,"Once our order was in and the check ran, music was turned off and lights turned on like we didn't matter now that we were on the hook. NOT COOL!"
5,5,5,5,Service was great and attentive. Food was amazing - fresh and creative. Loved the outdoor seating also - it had a great ambiance!
5,5,5,5,All of the dishes we ordered were delicious and nicely presented.
5,5,5,4,Awesome food and the only thing better was the service! We will definitely return as they made a special night truly memorable!
5,5,5,5,Love this place. The food is impeccable and the manager is super nice!  My favorite restaurant period!
5,5,4,5,"Long wait but super accommodating, and amazing food!!"
3,4,4,3,Baked crab roll is amazing. Creamy Shrimp Tempura? Not so good.
5,5,5,5,"Brought my best friend here for her birthday. Food and service was great, as always. We had a really good time."
3,5,1,5,Great food but service people are rude.
5,5,5,5,Go there at least twice a month. David and Joey are perfect examples of being a great host and a great server. Very happy.
5,5,5,5,Waiter Leon was amazing David the manager was superb food was great could have been a little less noisy
5,5,5,5,Always great coming to this restaurant.
5,5,5,5,Had a great time ! The staff did an amazing job. Service was great and food was delicious as always !
5,5,5,5,love koi as always !we had a good dinner tnx 鈽嗏槅鈽嗏槅鈽
5,5,5,5,Excelente!!!
5,5,5,5,The management and service was excellent. Food of corse awesome
5,5,5,5,koi is always fantastic. one of my favourites in LA.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing GM, staff, Managers!! Fantastic food!"
5,5,5,5,"Great tasting sashimi!! Not so excited about the filet, but then again it鈥檚 not a steak house. Cocktails were delicious."
5,5,5,5,The best service!!!
5,5,5,5,"We have been coming to Koi for many years, one of our favs!"
5,5,5,5,We truly love it here!
5,5,5,5,Great Service.Daily Specials.Variety of Sake.Friendly stuff ! Food was also fresh and tasty.
5,5,5,4,We had a delicious dinner and the service was outstanding!
2,1,3,2,Overpriced and not that good.
5,5,5,5,Great sushi and place
5,5,5,5,"Dark, hip, and beautiful. Lovely outside patio. Busy inside but noise level is manageable. Two of us had sushi - very fresh. The other had sea bass which was a large portion and delicious. For dessert we shared a Koi sundae which was more than enough for three people and spectacular in presentation. Joey, our server was friendly and attentive. A fun evening."
5,5,5,5,"The food, atmosphere, and service were top notch.  The icing on the cake for me was that the manager went out of his way outside of business hours to return my credit card to me at my hotel!! This just goes to show that they go above and beyond for their customers.  Our party of 4 felt very comfortable and welcome from beginning to end.  I could not be more happier with the experience and will return i the near future."
5,5,5,5,"Food was amazing, service was first class!"
3,3,4,4,Not a true Japanese restaurant - more of a lounge bar where you can have a drink and pretend you know cool asian food
5,4,5,4,"We have been long time customers at Kokkari's San Francisco.  The food, the service and the location are awesome!"
4,4,4,4,Overpriced. Bring a wheelbarrow full of money if you want to eat here. Food is good but nothing special.
4,4,5,5,Food was good but not outstanding . Maybe I didn鈥檛 get the right dishes . I would go back but not anytime soon
5,5,5,4,Excellent food and service
5,5,5,5,Over the years I鈥檝e been at least a couple dozen times as both a host and guest and the food is always great. This past time my lamb souvlaki plate came out cold which was disappointing - it happens.
5,5,5,5,"Service was fantastic. We had a lovely Greek wine, the persimmon salad, saganaki, dolmades, flat beans with tomato sauce, moussaka, tzatziki and baklava Icecream. All wonderful. Especially loved the salad, flat beans."
3,4,2,4,"It was our third visit and this time, I felt rushed, the food came in before our wine, the dessert came before the coffee.  I had my meal almost within the hour. I understand they have another service ( I was there at 6pm) but this was too much for me."
5,5,5,5,"The best restaurant in SF. The food is amazing and the dessert is top notch too. I normally never order dessert, and we ordered 3!"
5,5,5,5,"Another great experience @ the BEST spot in town!  Always a treat to dinner here, the server was superb w getting us in & out before MADONNA.  Martini鈥檚, yes please and a bunch of appetizers from saganiki, grill calamari, fried smelt, assorted Meze鈥檚 to the seasonal persimmon salad, all fresh and full of flavor but wait dessert, OMG, seasonal sorbet w/custard ice cream & this citrus meringue w/crispy phyllo crust....the 4 of us were ready to paint the town!"
5,5,5,5,"Delicious meal, from appetizer to dessert.  Kokkari is a MUST stop whenever we venture into San Francisco."
2,3,2,2,They seated me at the worst table in the restaurant and treated me like they were better than me. They work in a restaurant!
5,5,5,5,This place never disappoints. It is always my first choice when in the city. 馃檶馃徑
5,5,5,5,Beautiful restaurant and service. Can鈥檛 wait to return
5,5,5,5,The best. A real favorite. Will go anytime Ivan get in.
5,5,5,5,Delicious!!!
5,5,5,5,Loved it. The Lamb chops were especially delicious. I would highly recommend it.
5,5,5,5,The most welcoming comforting satisfying restaurant in the Bay Area
5,5,5,5,This continues to be one of my long time favorites in San Francisco. Best Lamb chops and only place I ever order them.
4,4,5,5,"Was excited to try this since so many people have recommended it. Obviously a business dinner spot from the clientele, but I went for date night. We loved the wine selection and food. The restaurant was a little warm and dark, though."
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful experience with excellent service. Raphael, our server, guided us beautifully."
5,5,5,5,My friend who I hadn鈥檛 seen in 20+ yrs was in town for a business conference and I got to pick the restaurant. I didn鈥檛 realize that she husband is Greek and from a big Greek family.  Kokkari delivered as usual and she was impressed with the quality and authenticity.
5,5,5,5,BEST restaurant in SF!  Food is excellent and always consistent.  The service is extraordinary and the ambiance is wonderful.
5,5,5,5,"Great food, great service!  Enough said."
5,5,5,5,This place is always spectacular. The food the ambience.
5,5,5,5,Great food...attentive staff..noise level too high but then it is a big restaurant and when full that is to be expected....but it also is a deterrent to return
5,5,5,5,"Never disappoints, hands down my favorite restaurant in the city!"
5,5,5,5,The staff was very friendly and nice. We loved the lentil soup and lamb souvlaki for lunch. We would love to come back again soon
5,5,5,5,Brilliant!
5,5,5,4,"We celebrated a special, anniversary evening at Kokkari and were so happy we did. The food was delicious and the service was both friendly and professional throughout."
1,5,1,5,It caught on fire after we got appetizers and we couldn鈥檛 go back in
5,5,5,5,Only the beat from the greeting to the dessert
5,5,5,5,"the food was excellent, the decoration was great and the service was fan-tas-tic ... a must-go place when in SF"
5,5,5,5,"Great atmosphere and food....very goodPlace toGo with friends, work people, or date...."
5,5,4,5,"Amazing food !!   Place is fantastic,  lamb shank was supergood, well served ,  and the fried cheese was incredible"
5,5,5,5,"We can鈥檛 wait to go back! Service was exceptional, food delicious and perfect ambience."
5,5,5,5,Tony the bartender is amazing.  Super friendly.  Also a pleasure seeing him.  Our server was lovely and the food amazing.
4,3,4,3,"We had a few people recommending us this restaurant, it was descent food (not outstanding) nice service and we found out later that inside the restaurant there was a real ambiance.We were seated all the way in the front of the restaurant where there was not a real ambiance.Totally would try the restaurant again next time in SF just would request a different table."
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful food. Avgolemono is a perfect blend of creamy rice, chicken and lemon.  The Concord grape granitas an excellent way to end the meal. Service was flawless as usual."
5,5,4,5,"Lovely Greek food, we had saganaki and spanakopita for starters along with the beautiful break and olive oil.  Mains were the special goat stew and the rotisserie lamb.  Both courses were excellent.  The wine list is excellent - good quality reasonably priced wines for ""everyday"" and an excellent wine list for those anniversaries/birthdays/celebrations.  We had a half bottle of Krug champagne and an excellent 2010 Gran Reserve Rioja.Overall, it is my favourite restaurant in San Francisco..."
3,3,4,4,The charred octopus was perfect. Moussaka and goat stew good. Greek 鈥渄onuts鈥 nothing special. Restaurant doesn鈥檛 live up to the hype.
5,5,5,5,"Welcoming staff, charming and cozy dining room with a wood burning fireplace, sea bass was perfectly cooked. Everyone especially loved the fennel soup and the pumpkin mousse cake.  I thought the chairs were a bit uncomfortable, but nobody else thought so. Overall, a most pleasant dining experience."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful dining experience.  Made our special family celebration even more more special.  Thanks.
5,5,5,5,Great as always!! Thank you!!
5,5,5,5,Top 10 .. hard to beat. Only issue too many great dishes to chose from
5,5,5,5,"This was our first trip back after many years, and we were wondering if it was still as good as we remembered.  We shouldn't have worried- it is still our favorite special occasion place!  Cozy ambience on a cold night, great food, excellent waitstaff- what's not to like.  We only hope that we will be able to visit again without waiting so long between trips!"
5,4,5,5,A lovely spot for our anniversary. The service is impeccable which can be hard to come by these days. Old school class. Great sommelier. Quintessential french in atmosphere. We were seated in front of a fireplace and given a special dessert.
5,5,5,5,"An exceptional experience, as always! Attentive service, great ambiance, and outstanding food from start to finish."
5,5,5,5,"We had a delightful lunch at L'Auberge.  We enjoyed the Filet of Sole special which is always a treat.  We experienced an example of the thoughtful service that is a hallmark of L'Auberge.  One of our party quietly asked if the Amuse Bouche contained dairy as she is lactose intolerant.  From then on, she was offered options if what she had ordered might contain dairy ingredients."
5,5,5,5,The food and service are always outstanding!  The staff go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and enjoy your dining experience.
5,5,5,5,Went there for my wife鈥檚 recent promotion.  Our meals were fantastic.  I loved the desserts as well.  Nice quiet atmosphere and the ride to get to the restaurant is scenic as well.  Not a bad thing to say about the place.  I recommend to anyone for a special occasion because it is a bit pricey but worth every penny.
5,5,5,5,Outstanding experience!
5,5,5,5,Excellent evening out in every respect!!! We are now hoping to bring the family for a Christmas time outing.
5,5,5,5,The food was amazing. Always a great experience.
5,5,5,5,"Terrific and special place. I have never been disappointed at L' Auberge Chez Francois. We always have a special experience with absolutely delicious food. Every course-- even the palette cleansers, were amazing. We were a table of six this time with plenty of high-end restaurant experience, and everyone at the table was wowed by the flavors of our food choices. The ambience is so fabulously old world and lovely that it makes the experience so much more than a good meal. It's not the place to go for ""new age chef"" avante garde flavor combos if that's what you're after, but the flavors at L' Auberge are wonderful, and the truly enjoyable experience goes beyond the food and drinks."
5,5,5,5,"As always, our experience was lovely.  The food and ambiance are always what we look forward to.  The wait staff is superb."
5,5,5,5,"Friends getting together ... one had never been, and one had not been here in ages.  Decided we would definitely be back as great place to have a relaxing lunch and be able to catch up with friends while eating fabulous food and desserts!"
5,5,5,5,"Had a long time friend in from out of state. Wanted to treat her to something special! It was the perfect spot! Beautiful, delicious, excellent service, what more could we ask? She felt very celebrated for coming all that way to visit! Thank you Chef Jacques & team!"
5,5,5,5,"L'Auberge Chez Francois is our favorite restaurant for special events, and has been for 50 years. It has been a memorable experience every single visit. The food, service and ambience are excellent."
5,5,5,5,A favorite place to dine for special occasions for over 40 years.  Beautiful setting with delicious fresh food and great service.
4,5,4,4,"Service was a bit off from typical experience. Wait staff was not as attentive as normal, and appropriate for cost.  Meal was very good, and ambiance pleasant."
5,5,5,5,"Great service, as usual and the food was amazing!"
4,5,5,5,Wonderful experience; wonderful food; wonderful service.
5,5,5,5,The only down side was a large party that came in and were extremely loud but not too much could be done about it. Management automatically apologised after another couple complained.Great place otherwise.
5,5,5,5,"We have eaten here a number of evenings.  Everything was fantastic, as usual.  Thanks."
2,2,3,3,"The good - the salads and lobster were well prepared.The bad - the scallops were very overcooked, and the fish was overcooked.This is simply unexpected, and unacceptable, from a restaurant at this level and price point.   Disappointing and not recommended."
2,5,5,2,"I have been going to L鈥橝uberge Chez Francois for 30 yrs, not happy with past Saturday:  Dining Romney crowded and very noisy! Inexperienced new waiter though trying very hard. Number one rule: waiters should be smiling!!! Hot mulled wine (Gl眉hwein) should only be served in glasses with handles (take it from a German). Though rare,  this was a disappointing visit."
5,5,5,5,"We all had a wonderful time at lunch yesterday, celebrating two mutual birthdays.  My tenderloin was the best I have had anywhere.  Trout, salmon, and scalopini pleased the others at the table.  While the food was outstanding, our waiter made the meal particularly memorable.  He was efficient, thoughtful, amusing--outstanding service!A great value!"
5,5,5,5,"Our lunch was perfect! Service is engaging and not at all intrusive. When asked, our waiter was so helpful with choices from the very extensive 4-course menu. My husband's Lobster bisque was not too rich, but deep in flavor. Wonderful surprise in a ceasar salad topped with quail egg and anchovies. Filet of beef tenderloin was among the best he's had.  I had a marvelous Roquefort cheese tart with caramelized apples that was elegant and divine. I was excited to order one of my favorite and seldom seen- calf's liver, smoked bacon and carmelized onions.  It was perfection! Literally melted in my mouth. Desserts look and taste sublime so we couldn't resist the cheesecake and a raspberry souffle -- then they surprised us with some Baked Alaska since it was our anniversary! For such a premier meal and location in the countryside of Great Falls, the meal was also an incredible value. Can hardly wait to go back."
4,5,4,4,"Through the OpenTable app when making the reservation, I left some special instructions which were ignored by the host. Beyond that, the inside looks a little dated. Some dingy doilie-type hung over the lattice obscuring the view of the room. Definitely could use a new interior paint job...(and a lot more).There's also a section for ""tie-wearers"" and a section for everyone else (same menu, I'm afraid...)... the back dining room is reserved for ties.Our meals were terrific. Good service. Do yourself a favor, by the way, and order the baked Alaska."
4,4,3,4,It was a good evening. The dining experience takes longer than normal but food is very good
5,5,5,5,Everything about our lunch was wonderful. Service was outstanding and the food incredible as usual. We throughly enjoyed ourselves and look forward to our next visit.
5,5,5,5,We love lbcf. Food awesome. Service awesome. Ambience lovely. Only issue was guy using s word and f word openly 2 tables away.  Not your fault but it鈥檚 critical to know we can go there without experiencing that. How can you shut this down? Not sure. But it matters. Eager to return. Dan
3,3,4,3,The service was great and the meal was decent but I have to say for the price it wasn鈥檛 worth it.  The food was all very heavy and very old school.  Everything was covered in heavy sauces and kind of tasted the same.  I understand that French cuisine is heavy on sauce and butter but even the more modern places are more creative with the way they sauce dishes now.  The best thing we had were definitely the souffl茅s!!
4,4,5,2,Fabulousl very attentive service. Great place for special occasions
5,5,5,5,"A wonderful place that has incredibly well prepared and served meals, within a eloquent setting and with stellar services. If you want the best of Alsace food, this is THE place for you to partake."
5,4,5,5,"L'Auberge Chez Francois is always perfect and has been since I first started going there in 1976.  My only regrets are that it's a long way from home thru some of the region's worst traffic, and its cost relegates it to special occasions."
5,5,5,5,L鈥橝uberge never fails to impress. Their food and service is without peer. The seasonal specials are excellent but the regular menu items are equally as delicious. For such a long running business  they keep the experience fresh and new.
5,5,5,5,"This is always a classic.  I鈥檝e been eating here since 1983!  The food is always great, the staff is first class and the ambience is wonderful.  Jaques should be very proud to have continued his father鈥檚 excellence and tradition in the best way.  Bravo!"
5,5,5,5,"I hadn't been here for dinner in so long, so worth the trip back!  Can't wait to return to try their lunch menu."
5,5,5,5,"As always, meals at L'Auberge Chez Francois are always perfection on a plate.  We took Mama to dinner to celebrate a birthday, and she loved every minute of it, from the perfectly prepared Rob Roy to the exquisite birthday meringue.  We'll return - no doubt about it!"
5,5,5,5,"La Grotta is the standard. Always exceptional in food quality, service and atmosphere."
5,5,5,5,"Incredible meal. Every time I eat here, I wonder why I don鈥檛 come here more often. Meal portions are perfect; the pasta is cooked to perfection and the service is stellar."
5,5,5,3,Tables were really close together and it would have been nice to have a bit more space From our neighbors but the service was great and the food was even better!
5,5,5,5,Always a fun time at LaGrotta!  Such a great place to celebrate or just enjoy the food and service.  A must go place if you live in Atlanta!  Can't wait to go back!
5,5,5,5,"Every time it鈥檚 an experience that you treasure. Truly the BEST Italian in Atlanta, GA"
5,5,5,5,"This was a great experience! I love how La Grotta is hidden! The timing of each part of the meal was perfect, the service was nice, and the food was good! Great for a romantic date night!"
5,5,5,5,"I took my two out of town friends for their first time here, and La Grotta did not disappoint. It was, as always, outstanding!"
5,5,5,5,My first time experiencing truffles and they were shaved table side. They didn鈥檛 disappoint! The service was impeccable as well!
4,4,5,4,Food not quite as good as I had remembered but I would go back.
5,5,5,5,Great restaurant! Went there for our anniversary. Amazing food and service :)
5,5,5,3,"Excellent in every way. The food was excellent but was lacking with the vegetables with the lamb chops. Other tables had so much more than we received, other wise excellent"
5,5,5,5,Lovely. Warm and friendly waiter. Will always come back
5,5,5,5,Best restaurant in Atlanta
5,5,5,5,"La Grotta is unequivocally the best restaurant in Atlanta.  Hard to think of another that even comes close, much less competes.  Not enough superlatives to describe the food, wine, service, or any other aspect of the experience.  On pleasant evenings, the patio is wonderful.  I've been going for probably 30 years, and it remains as great as ever."
5,5,5,5,Great service and food was wonderful
5,5,5,5,We love La Grotta! It never falls short of perfect each time we dine. Every aspect from start to finish is always phenomenal!
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food and service. This place really is a hidden gem! If you are looking for fresh authentic Italian food, this is the spot. Would definitely visit again in the future."
5,5,5,5,Phenomenal
5,5,5,5,Always the best!
3,4,5,3,"La Grotta has long been our favorite restaurant, with great ambiance, service and food. We went this week to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and were terribly unhappy with the noise level. It was a Tuesday night, but the restaurant was packed, with everyone talking loudly to make themselves heard over the crowd. The worst was the table near us, where 3 young couples were seated, and one young woman was inebriated and talking loudly in a shrill voice that was impossible to tune out. The worst was when she stood up, lost her balance and fell to the floor! Not the kind of thing we're used to in this legendary and distinguished restaurant!"
5,5,5,5,Our first experience at La Grotta will definitely not be our last. We were warmly greeted by both valet and hostess upon our arrival and promptly sat in a very comfortable banquette. It was our anniversary and it had definitely been communicated to staff. Brett acted as our gastronomic "sherpa" through the menu and both he and Roberto provided very humorous quips when visiting the table. Christian regaled us with the history of the restaurant along with his family's storied connection with it and Atlanta.  Casual yet upscale without pretension. I saw a picture of Shaquille O'Neal on the wall and am still trying to figure out how he fitted down there. Will definitely return.
5,5,5,5,"Both of my friends were from out of town and had never been to La Grotta.  one was from New York, and the other from Nashville.  They loved everything about the service, food, etc., and can't wait to come back again.Sincerely,  Susan Mathis  (Mrs. T. Harvey)"
5,5,5,5,"Celebrating our dear friends anniversary was a delightful evening at La Grotta! Our Waiter, Tony, was delightful and our food simply delicious!"
5,5,5,5,Food was amazing. Service was wonderful.
4,5,5,4,Always a great experience. Chef has been there for 41 years and it shows.  Awesome
2,5,1,1,"My friend and I arrived on time with a reservation...checkin with the host was sluggish, we were seated after 10 minutes.......sat at your very nice table and wited 20 minutes for any attention, not even water. I had to raise my hand eventually to get anyones attention. We were asked if we would like a cocktail or wine....our response was that we鈥檇 have a bottle of wine. What would you like he said......we asked for a consult on the menu and specials to make that selection.....not appropriate. They all scrambled and finally fell into shape. The wine sommelier helped us after a no-assigned waiter explained menu items and answered our questions. The meal was superb! Was this a one off night? Who knows, however, a neighboring couple could be heard critiquing similar complaints as a frequent neighborhood client. The ambiance between guest and management was VERY CROONY oriented....many regulars who got preferred treatment. What they didn鈥檛 know, we were out-of-towners yet my guest had dined there at least 20 times. SO, the food was superb, but they were a bit aloof, disorganized and disheveled. Even the Valet was corny oriented and disorganized."
5,5,5,5,Great experience my first wedding anniversary with my wife we really enjoy the waiters food was amazing 馃槫馃憤馃榿
5,5,5,5,A wonderful place to dine with friends or business associates.  Food is superb!  Wait staff is outstanding!  Wish I could eat there every week.  Have been eating there since it opened in 1978.  Never had a meal or experience that was anything but excellent.
5,5,5,5,Absolutely amazing food. I can鈥檛 wait to go back!
5,5,5,5,Wonderful evening. It was my birthday. Surprised how crowded it was for a Wednesday night. Ordered a side vegetable because usually green beans and carrots are not good. These were amazing. Everything I had was the best I ever had. It was obvious I was in a highly rated fine dining restaurant. Best tiramisu ever!
5,5,5,5,Great experience. Haven鈥檛 been for awhile and I have no idea why not?!
5,5,5,5,Perfection. How have I never been here before?
3,2,1,4,"Food was just ok, service very slow. This used to be a high quality restaurant known for its true Italian cuisine and great service. The last two times I have been there it feels more like restaurant that caters to the convention/ business client."
5,5,5,5,"An old favorite-still great!  With Chef Antonio at the helm, absolutely no one makes a better spaghetti carbonara. All dishes are top quality delicious"
5,5,5,5,We were celebrating our daughters birthday as she had never been. The meal and service was outstanding as always. Now our daughter and boyfriend are huge fans.
5,5,5,5,Very good food. They're know for the veal. Desserts also fantastic. Good wine list. Unique location you wouldn't imagine there'd be a hidden high class Italian restaurant located here but there is. Will certainly return.
5,5,5,5,I frequent La Grotta. Always terrific. Love the sacchetti and veal chop with fresh truffles when in season. Enjoy dining on the patio! Can't go wrong with any of their deserts.
4,4,5,4,"Lovely dinner. Food was traditional Italian. Nothing too out of the box, but very delicious! My Italian mother loved it!"
5,5,5,5,Best restaurant in Atlanta!  Best Veal Chop in ATL!Best ambiance in Atlanta!Best service in Atlanta!
5,5,5,5,Our waiter Tex was fantastic. All of the wait staff was great. The food was awesome. Good experience overall.
5,5,5,4,"Wonderful food, very attentive staff. Thank you!"
5,5,5,5,Great food and service!
5,5,5,5,We had the best service since being on the island!  Katie was wonderful!!
5,5,5,5,One of our maui favorites for date night.
4,5,5,5,"Still the most elegant, wonderful dining experience in Lahaina ... my only area of awareness for our years of visiting...the prices are increasing faster than the wallet can sustain!"
3,3,3,3,"For the quality of the food, the meals were significantly overpriced. The main dishes were not plated or composed in any original manner.  The drinks were additionally not well balanced.  Overall, for as many positive reviews as we had researched, this was a complete letdown.  It鈥檚 not that the food was terrible by any means; it was a descent meal, but overall, for the overblown cost- our ~$450 meal was more of a $200 to $250 value."
5,5,5,5,"What an incredible experience.  Everything was perfect. The food was amazing, service spectacular and everyone was so friendly.  Best restaurant we have ever been ."
5,5,5,5,Our server was wonderful. Buddy was her name and was so knowledgeable!
5,5,5,5,Great place great service outstanding food!
5,5,5,5,We came for our anniversary and couldNotHaveChosen a better venue.  Everything was over theTop and hope to come again
5,4,5,5,"This was a spectacular experience. The owner introduced himself to every table and the service was on their game. Unfortunately, the plating for my main course wasn鈥檛 up to par (especially since it was one of the specials). It was still very good. Everything else was wonderful. This is definitely a restaurant we will return to."
5,5,5,5,Excellence food and great wine selection. Started with Shanghai spring rolls and seafood cake. I did Kona rubbed lamb.  All was very well executed.
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful dinner with very attentive service.  Wine list is very diverse but tends to the pricier side of things.  Servers don鈥檛 push the expensive wines and will find you a very nice wine to fit your budget.  We had the best beet and goat cheese salad that we have ever had, and followed that up with Osso Buco and some Mahi-mahi.  Main courses were both superb."
5,5,5,5,I would go back again if I could! Loved it!
5,5,5,4,Always fabulous. One of the best in Maui. Excellent service.
5,5,5,5,Everything great but overpriced.
4,4,4,3,There was an extremely loud party group right beside our table that took away from our enjoyment of the meal.
5,5,5,5,Fabulous!  This is our absolute favorite when visiting Maui.  So few restaurants reach this level of quality.  The menu selection meets everyone's needs. I love the fresh seafood and the subtle delicious sauces added with a light touch.  Service is outstanding. The noise level is unfortunately high. I recommend an early reservation for quieter dining.
5,5,5,3,"When we walked in we couldn't believe how crowded and noisy it was for a fancy expensive restaurant.  But the service and food were outstanding.  We shared an appetizer and 2 entrees, and all were exceptional.  Great food and wine recommendations and service by Salvador."
5,5,5,5,One of our favorite places to eat when in Maui!!
5,5,5,3,The food and service were exceptional!
3,5,5,4,"The fan and air conditioning were aimed at us.  Thankfully, our server delivered a shawl.The noise level is very high every where in the restaurant. That is difficult for folks with hearing issues.Probably not the place we should visit often.We enjoyed conversation with the salad creator.We were very happy with service and with the delicious scallops."
5,5,5,5,"Highly recommend, this was one of my favorite dining experiences. The service was also very friendly really enjoyed talking to Buddy and Mahina.  The food was top-notch, I had a local fishing today and my wife had the mahi-mahi both were amazing And the sauce is paired and flavors are out of this world."
4,5,5,5,"A bit over priced, yet food was very good and service was outstanding!"
5,5,5,5,Very attentive staff but not annoying .  Food never disappoints !! Always look forward to Lahaina Grill!! Worth every $$.
5,5,5,5,"This restaurant is amazing! The service was spectacular, we couldn't have hoped for more delicious food, and the ambiance was just the right level of romantic. The only downside was that the restaurant was fairly noisy but not to the extent we couldn't hear each other. We definitely recommend Lahaina Grill!"
5,5,5,5,The food and service could not have been better.
5,5,4,3,Amazing  seafood!  No frills ambiance and put the effort where it really matters.
5,5,5,5,Bartenders and waiter Richard were awesome. Made our celebration very special!
5,4,5,5,Fantastic food servers went out of the way to be helpful best resturant in maui
5,5,5,5,"We had the most fabulous dinner , the service was over the top. Great food and a very welcome atmosphere with the best staff on the planet. Thanks for making us feel so special!!"
5,5,5,5,Great food and great service. Here for a honeymoon dinner and they made it a great experience!
5,5,5,5,"Special dinner for our few days and this was an absolute hit! It will be a first go to on our next trip. Mariana was our server and was just fabulous! Love, love, loved our evening here!"
3,5,2,3,Amazing food but slow service. Service there was not on par with Mama鈥檚 Fish House.
4,5,5,5,"The service was superb! My wife had the yellow snapper special which was good, I had the scallops which were wonderful.  There was a small issue with my 1st two wine choices not being available, but management offered me a bottle at a slightly higher price point at the same price as my first choice... and it turned out to be a wonderful Pinot Noir.    GREAT staff."
5,5,5,5,"We heard about this place from a few people, and it did not disappoint!  So many amazing dishes, we were too full after the first two courses...sadly.   Enjoyed the Wagyu Beef Ravioli SO much...absolutely delectable.   Service was top notch, prices seems reasonable, nice and charming location.   Will definitely return, and start where we left off!  Thanks Lahaina!"
2,1,5,4,"I ordered the Veal Chop, medium rare. It came to the table medium to medium well!Thank staff for removing item from bill and also for asking if I wanted a replacement. I declined the replacement fortwo reasons. One reason was I did not want to eat after my Wife had finished her meal (which she enjoyed!). The other reason was that if a quality restaurant like yours can't get it right the first time then what  would I get as a replacement?"
5,5,5,4,"The service was excellent, the food quality, best around front st.  Everything was excellent, except the noise level was pretty high."
5,5,5,5,Easily one of the top five restaurants in all of the US but without the high price tag. This place could easily raise their prices 20% and still be the least expensive of the top ten and would continue to trump the others. Foie Gras and seared Ahi followed by Surf & Turf and then pie... Unbeatable. Lahaina Grill... Me + You = :)
5,5,5,5,The best service I have ever had.  The food was also delicious! Definitely get the wild berry pie for dessert.
5,5,5,5,"Wow, we had a great meal and amazing service! Will definitely be back."
5,5,4,4,"The host was very helpful, and the food was of course delicious.  We ate at the bar since we were three, rather than the announced two, but was perfectly ok."
5,5,5,5,Amazing dining experience. Every course was amazing. Highly recommend the brussel sprouts!
5,5,5,5,"One of my favorite places in the city. Amazing dishes using seasonal ingredients, attentive service, and an all around great experience every single time."
2,4,2,2,"While the food was very good the restaurant is over crowded, extremely noisy and the service was just OK. It was so noisy the waitress was almost unable to hear the order and had to come back and ask several times about our selections. Seating is so crowded you can hardly get to your seat without bumping into other customers or having to move the table."
3,3,3,2,Was not expecting a brunch only menu - I mistakenly thought it would be a full lunch menu - felt quite rushed as kitchen closed at 3.00pm and we had a 2 o clock reservation- I felt this should have been conveyed to us in the booking confirmation I was recommended this restaurant and booked prior to departing from my home in Australia with very limited options of dining times
5,5,5,5,Food and service were everything you can ask for.  Was hoping they could offer a bit more variety for lunch/brunch service.  Cheers.
5,4,5,5,It was a wonderful experience. Was meeting a friend after a long time. Upstairs provided the perfect ambience for a lovely chat over good food and wine.Servers were attentive to our needs. I have allergies and I felt taken care of very well.
2,1,4,4,"Tagliatelle was bland, orichiette too. Scallops chewy and very strong flavor. Service was on point tho."
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding meal! A reliable, quality, wonderful, and quintessential New York restaurant!"
4,5,4,5,Amazing food. Felt rushed by the wait staff & rapid preparation of the courses.
5,5,5,5,Always a favorite. A must when in NYC
5,5,5,5,"Servers were absolutely excellent and attentive but not intrusive. Food was phenomenal, as was the dining space. Loved sitting at the kitchen bar seating."
5,5,5,5,My wife and I ate brunch there with our two grown children who live nearby. Place was GREAT. Food was delicious and the waiter was superb.  Can鈥檛 wait to go back
5,5,5,5,"Best restaurant in the West Village.  Service is incredible, and can't say enough about the food."
5,5,5,5,My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and L鈥檃rtusi made us feel so special! We sat down and they brought us a toast on the house and then after being too full to actually order dessert...they packed us a Togo back of the olive oil cake for us to enjoy later. It鈥檚 one of our favorites in the City and we will always go back!
3,4,1,2,Host was awful. Waiting an hour for a table that you reserved a month in advance doesn鈥檛 make for a great experience.
2,5,1,2,Michelin quality food bush league service
5,5,5,5,This is the best Italian food in nyc without question
5,5,5,5,The food was delicious and the service was great! We鈥檒l come again for sure
5,5,5,5,"The food was absolutely amazing! Best Italian food I鈥檝e ever had. I can鈥檛 tell you which food was my favorite because each item was equally delicious. They all were good. I can鈥檛 remember specific names but we ordered a pasta that had lamb neck, a fish dish, the special of the day which was similar to gnocchi, potato soup, olive oil cake and a chocolate pudding. Yum!!! And the ambiance was great.  I will definitely be coming back. Just remember to make reservations way in advanced. It鈥檚 hard to get one because it鈥檚 so yummy! Now I know why."
3,5,2,2,We had gotten a late night reservation and felt rushed thru our dining experience by the staff. No tasting notes for the wine list. Portion sizes were very good.
5,4,5,5,Wonderful! We sat upstairs which was a little quieter than downstairs. The service was phenomenal! Not stuffy. And of course the food was excellent. Get the spaghetti!
5,5,5,5,Unbelievable
5,5,5,5,"Have heard great things about the restaratunt and it did not dissapoint! The olive oil cake was definitely a highlight and the pasts were all amazing,"
5,5,5,5,"Great food, some of the best I've ever had. Unique and very flavorful dishes. Highly recommend if you can grab a table. And do not skip dessert!"
4,3,4,4,"Nice restaurant but didn't fully live up to the hype/long wait time between making a reservation and having one. The scallop ceviche was excellent, as was the olive oil cake (the best thing on the menu). But I was a bit disappointed with the mushroom ragu garganelli. It was missing something. Still, excellent staff and service and would recommend to others."
5,4,5,5,"The food here is inventive and delicious.   The shishito peppers are the best in the city in my opinion.Lively atmosphere and great service round out the meal.  Only problem - apparently many feel this way so it's very hard to get a reservation, plus wine could be priced lower; however, food prices are very reasonable for NYC, especially given the quality and the taste."
4,4,3,4,The food was great. Staff tries to hard to be formal. Too loud - hard to hold a conversation. Beautiful space.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing as Always! Simply delicious is the perfect word for it. The Rabbit Gnocchi & the Mint Lamb Pici are an absolute must!!! The Kobe Tar-Tar was incredible, feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to taste such deliciousness! Just a great meal, do not think twice, a must to dine!"
5,5,5,5,"Tough to get a reservation. Literally tried for a year. But now that I went, can see why it鈥檚 so crowded!"
5,5,5,5,"We celebrated our anniversary here and had a wonderful time. They started us off with a complimentary glass of sparking wine. We then had the cheese special, 2 pastas, pork chop and the olive oil cake. Everything was fantastic and our waitress was very nice and did an amazing job helping us pick a bottle of wine to go with our meal. Overall, great experience!"
3,4,2,3,"It wasn't as good as it was last time. The service wasn't the best. The food was tasty as usual. But it was really loud (music) and the service kept forgetting my milk. My side of scrambled eggs never came, but I just let it go... We had four coffees and they gave us such little cream, we must have asked like 4 times for more. I thought that was a little annoying. I think the server was brand new... I'd recommend it for dinner, but not brunch."
5,5,5,5,My absolute favorite restaurant in New York! Never disappoints!
5,5,5,5,Great meal.  Always the perfect experience.
5,5,5,5,"Have been to This restaurant about half a dozen of times over several years when we are visiting NYC and it is one of our favorite/ go to restaurants there.  This trip visiting our daughter and her boyfriend.  Our waiter Shawn was excellent describing the specials, providing info on the regular menu, and helping us order a very fine meal.  Once we got the food all dialed in, he helped us select a very nice bottle of wine to pair with the food... and it was a good price value.  Thanks for another great meal, fun evening."
5,5,5,5,"The staff is the best. The food is the best. Everything is always, always perfection."
5,5,5,3,Amazing food and service! Waitress was super friendly and attentive. Only negative was the table we were at was close together with the one next to us so we could hear each others conversations clearly. Next time I would ask for a counter seat or a different table but everything else was great!
5,5,4,5,Great food.
4,4,3,2,"The service was a bit slow, but as it was a Saturday night and crowded, it could be excused - except that any good NYC restaurant should be ready for a busy Saturday. And we were told -repeatedly - that we would be served in time to leave at no later than 7:15 as we were heading to a 7:30 performance down the street. Oops.The gin fizz was perfection - I imagine I'd have found the exact one in a 20s speakeasy. The wine list is fantastic and the menu very appealing. The special steak tartare was incredible - I shall be wondering how to replicate it for months as it is not a common dish.  My friend was rapturous over the sweetbreads - the second time she ordered them there - again, an uncommon dish. Three of us were delighted with the tagliatelle and the branzino was enjoyed with gusto by the rest of our party. Sadly. we had to bounce before we could enjoy coffee or dessert - this is really not a place for pre-performance meals - rushing does no justice to the superb cocktails and wine or the dinner menu. The greatest drawback is the noise level - the music was so loud that patrons were screaming above it and each other - but I guess that's what the kids are used to these days..."
5,5,5,5,"The food, service, and ambience were all fantastic.  The services provided by the professional management and staff are the main reasons that we keep coming back.   The old world elegance is a rare thing, and we value their focus to make sure that everything about the dining experience is excellent.   I highly recomend this restaurant."
5,5,5,5,Best burger and fries in town!Not too shabby lemon shortbread as well.
5,5,5,5,"Le Bilboquet understands the blend of food, service, and atmosphere. Just superb. The menu is wonderful - and there are always nightly specials. Wonderful wine list and attentive service. Just a wonderful restaurant, among the best in Dallas. Worth the drive."
5,5,5,5,"Reservation was for patio only as inside all booked.  It was a bit cool outside, and management worked hard to accommodate by providing an inside table.  Service was excellent in addition to the seating situation."
2,3,2,3,"I鈥檝e been there many times and enjoyed it , but this time the service was very poor. After bringing our food, we never saw our server again. After flagging her down to order dessert, she said they were sending out a complimentary birthday dessert. Maybe we wanted an additional dessert?  She never asked. Also, this was at lunch and there was a table of men there who were EXTREMELY loud鈥-to the point that we had to yell at each other to be heard. By the end of the meal, we were exhausted from it and very annoyed. Maybe someone could have asked them to tone it dow a little."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely delicious. Great service. Reasonable prices. Easy access
5,5,5,5,Always a wonderful experience and consistently excellent food.
5,5,5,5,"Great food, service, P谩tio was awesome."
5,5,5,5,Feels like Paris. Came for my dad鈥檚 60th. The manager Ricardo is so cordial and checked on us throughout to ensure we were happy. Left feeling cared for in a way I haven鈥檛 felt at other restaurants. Also a perfect brunch spot
5,5,5,2,"Our waiter, who said he is Persian, was exceptional in every way."
5,5,5,5,Fairly crowded tables!  Food was wonderful. Thanks
5,5,5,5,Loved it! The ambiance and meal were perfect! Will definitely be back.
5,5,5,5,"Great food, great atmosphere and the service was impeccable!"
5,5,5,5,FABULOUS WAY TO SPEND MY BIRTHDAY DINNER!  WE WILL BE BACK!
4,4,5,5,"We have been looking for A NEW French restaurant and found this as a recommendation and in a nice location if going to the Arts District. Ambiance was excellent re the setting both indoors and outside. Choose to eat in. We were pre symphony so started early, 5:45; by 6:30 it was filling and would recommend reservations if eating after 6:30!! Started with the tuna tartare that was outstanding! The dejon sauce was perfect!!! The presentation beautiful. Our server was excellent, and there was ample time between courses without asking!! My wife had the veal scallopini with pasta rather than potatoes. So the kitchen accommodates! The pasta was a bit overdone, but the veal and the flavor excellent. I had the lobster cappellini. The taste was superb, but again the pasta too soft and a bit over cooked. We will go back and would recommend. By the way, the servings were the right size!"
5,4,5,4,This restaurant is wonderful great choices of menu wonderful service always clean and I like that they will engage with you when you are celebrating...
4,5,4,4,Le Bilboquet is a brunch favorite.  Great service and atmosphere. I recommend their Eggs Benedict and Shakshuka and Cajun Chicken!!
1,1,1,3,"Bad service, LOUD....My husband is a vegetarian and the meager plate they brought was appalling.  None of us will return..."
5,5,5,5,"great experience always, great vibe...very friendly people."
5,5,5,5,Always a fun experience and they remembered my granddaughters birthday.
5,5,5,5,Our favorite restaurant in Dallas.
5,5,4,5,The restaurant if very open and airy fresh feeling with fresh roses on each table.Excellent selections on th menu and service was very good.We were celebrating a birthday and they generously comped our dessert.
5,3,4,5,It was JUST FINE
5,5,5,5,"The food, service, and ambience were all fantastic.  The services provided by the professional management and staff are the main reasons that we keep coming back.   The old world elegance is a rare thing, and we value their focus to make sure that everything about the dining experience is excellent.  Stephan, Edward, and now Ricardo are all exceptional hosts. I highly recomend this restaurant."
4,5,4,4,Everything was very good to excellent.  I would suggest using bread plates when serving bread and butter.
5,5,5,5,It鈥檚 always just perfect!
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful night celebrating a birthday. delicious food, great service, cant wait to go back"
4,2,3,3,"Sadly, my halibut was overcooked and dry. The frites, french fries were also dry.  But I like the ambience and the service is good and friendly. Music was a little loud."
5,5,5,5,One of our favorites.
5,5,5,5,"We love this place and eat brunch here whenever we are able. The ambiance is always great. Wonderfully plain, simple and relaxing decor. Music never too loud, temperature never too cold or hot. The service is fantastic and all of the team we have interacted with are friendly, helpful and not intrusive. And the food is simply fantastic: we almost feel disappointed if we eat anywhere else!"
4,4,5,4,Had the crab and avocado salad.  It was very good.  The Texas ribeye was delicious!  Service was excellent.
5,5,5,5,Fantastic. Seem to deliver a great quality experience each time we come.
5,5,5,5,Food is always fabulous. Actually the whole experience of dining at Le Bilboquet is fabulous. The wine selection is outstanding and service impeccable. Very very special always!
5,5,5,5,It was my husband鈥檚  birthday celebration with a few friends.  The food was wonderful as always and so was the service.  We 鉂わ笍the ambience.  The birthday dessert is the best with a firecracker candle.
5,5,5,5,Love!!! One of my absolute favorite places to eat in dallas
3,2,2,3,Forty-five minutes for order to arrive.  Eggs Benedict were over cooked on the first try and the hollandaise sauce was the poorest I鈥檝e ever had.
5,5,5,4,Always s delight! One of our very favorite restaurants.
5,5,5,5,Always a great choice for a fun evening with old friends.
5,5,5,5,"Impromptu girls lunch/birthday celebration. Le Bilboquet does not disappoint. Thoughtful attention to detail with surprise on fire lit dessert. We had the center of the room and it was a really fun time.  Delicious tuna tartare, poached salmon,interesting Cobb salad鈥 With Moet rose champagne!  The scene is local with business/social groups.  LOVE"
5,5,5,5,"This place consistently delivers ... quality food, service and atmosphere .."
5,5,5,5,In a word: EXTRAORDINARY!
5,5,5,5,"Great experience! Service , food and vibe! Highly recommend!! Top 10 restaurant in my list."
2,5,3,4,I don鈥檛 know if I would recommend Le Coucou for breakfast. It was such a huge let down with some breakfast dishes not being available.Two weeks prior I had gone for dinner which was an amazing meal and experience. Breakfast was the total opposite of dinner.
5,5,5,5,Unbelievable!!
5,5,5,5,Exceptional
5,5,5,4,"Le Coucou is a perfect place to relax and enjoy a lunch or dinner in a beautiful, pleasant atmosphere. The service is impeccable, very friendly, attentive and discreet. Needless to say that the dishes served here are wonderfully prepared."
5,5,5,5,A perfectly beautiful restaurant with charming service and delicious food !
5,5,4,4,Everything was amazing from start to finish.I just wished our server was a little happier that day and at least try to smile. The food was delicious and ambiance was just right.
5,5,5,5,Flawless French cooking accompanied by superb service
5,5,5,5,Amazing atmosphere and the service is impeccable. Food quality is top notch with a lot of deep flavors.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful dining experience.
5,5,5,5,Outstanding restaurant in all areas. My new firm favourite in NYC.
5,5,5,5,"Food was delicious, service amazing! We were expecting brunch, but we realized there wasn鈥檛 brunch, only lunch. It was amazing either way"
4,4,4,5,"Overall the restaurant was very good . I was disappointed that I couldn鈥檛 get a later time . The food was delicious , dessert could have been better . The decor is beautiful! . It is very pricey."
5,5,5,5,"I came here for my birthday about a week ago. Everything was absolutely perfect!! The whole experience was amazing- everyone was super friendly and attentive, the ambiance was stunning, and the food was amazing! Can鈥檛 wait to go back!"
5,5,5,5,Perfection
5,5,5,5,"What a wonderful dinner. Delicious food, stunning presentation, enchanting space. Erin the sommelier was amazing. Can鈥檛 say enough good things about Chef Rose鈥檚 latest jewel (I was a big fan of Spring in Paris). Can鈥檛 wait to come back!"
5,5,5,5,One of our favorite places. Never disappoints.
5,5,5,5,Our first date night since the birth of our baby son!
5,5,5,5,Food and service were excellent.  Restaurant is lovely.
5,5,5,5,Outstanding
2,3,1,4,"Host, seating and ambiance were fine. Service was unpleasant to say the least.We ordered the tasing menu and the second dish was so heavy that we couldn鈥檛 enjoy anything else. We asked whether we could take the dessert to go and they told us 鈥榥othing travels鈥... I thought, we are not going overseas just within the island ...not accommodating, we couldn鈥檛 even finish the bottle of wine that was definitively overpriced over 100, not value there. Bottom line, poor choice of appetizer on their side after telling me it was the lightest thing in the world...it was the heaviest I鈥檝e had for a while.The waitress was quite unpleasant and sarcastic. This place has negative value considering the prices vs. service and food. I can live with mediocre food but service is the core of going out to dinner.  Thumbs down."
5,5,4,5,"Gorgeous and romantic dining room. Food is fabulous. Excellent wine suggestions and pairings from the staff, and the Ma卯tre D' is one of the best in Manhattan. Look forward to many returns."
5,5,5,5,Loved it. Thanks for a wonderful evening.
3,4,2,5,Went for lunch with a business colleague.  The interior decor is spot on.  Subtle and spare but precisely executed.  The service however was seriously lacking.  We had the feeling that we walked in after a staff meeting and everybody was on the receiving end of some disciplinary action.  We didn't expect fun and lively but we also didn't expect a funeral.  Perhaps it was just timing but if we go back it will be for dinner.
5,5,5,5,Absolutely loved everything about Le Coucou. 鉂わ笍 I cannot wait to get the chance to return!
5,5,5,5,The creative menu was full of wonderful surprises.  I especially liked the crab salad.
5,5,5,5,"Food was great portions are on the smaller size but it was completely perfect. The ambiance is great, tables aren鈥檛 too close nor is it very loud, was able to fully enjoy my meal and my conversations!"
5,5,5,5,Superb in very way. Very comfortable dining alone. Marvelous service !
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food, service, ambience, vibe. A++++ all around!"
5,5,5,5,Delightful evening celebrating my birthday. They do a great set menu option of 4 courses which not everyone needs to order so you can get one set menu and one appetiser and one main for two people and share the other two dishes - means that you taste more flavours but don't leave feeling like you ate too much! Delicious!
4,4,5,5,"Only reason I didnt give a 5 star review, is that the lobster came lukewarm and not hot. Great taste, great service, great ambiance"
5,4,5,5,"The food and service was amazing, but the drink is a bit too expensive. This restaurant is great for special occasions, but not the best for regular occasions."
5,5,5,5,"A wonderful experience of modern French cuisine! We are not so much into fine dining, but here you can feel esteemed even without being a wine connoisseur! High recommendation!"
5,5,5,5,"The restaurant is very pretty with landscape wallpaper and large chandeliers, and was full during our meal.  Service was excellent, and our waiter even suggested a short wine flight to go with our lunch choices.  The wines and the food were very good.  We enjoyed a leisurely lunch without being rushed and it appeared that many of the other customers on that pleasant Saturday did as well."
4,5,5,4,"Having dined at Spring in Paris, I was  familiar with Chef鈥檚 talents.Having heard raves from friends,I was  excited about dining at Le Cou Cou and was not disappointed.A starter of quenelle was exquisite and my lobster main course as fine a preparation as I have had anywhere in the world.2 minor quibbles- the wine list was filled with expensive young wines and the soap in the washroom was too strongly scented.But I look forward to a return visit soon."
5,4,5,5,"Great and stylish restaurant. Food very good, ambience too, zinging along, we really enjoyed."
5,4,4,4,"fabulous  French Classic Menu . 3 guests  ,so we sampled  8 items .all  very very good . not the creme de la creme  -but outstanding  .highly reommnend, Bar noir de nos c么tes, saveurs Basques* and Quenelle de brochet 芦 Route de Reims 禄 . Snapper 脿 l鈥檈spagnole* was a bit of a disappointment .i know , a cliche , but would love to have seen  , escargot , blanquette  de veau ,and les oeufs a la neige  . incredible  lunch value !"
5,5,5,5,"The best filet we have ever had, and we have had great ones. We had a two course lunch and the food was delicious, the presentation was creative and gorgeous. The cocktails were unlike what you鈥檇 find anywhere else. If you love food and a pleasant atmosphere/service, then make this place a priority. Six stars."
5,5,5,5,La comida estuvo deliciosa
5,5,5,5,For any occasion!   A delight!
5,4,5,4,"A must dinning experience in DC. Little noisy, great service, ample menu."
5,5,5,5,Had a great experience! Excellent service and food was amazing.
5,5,5,5,"It's already my favorite restaurant in DC, but when I found out they were giving a meal on Veterans Day, I was shocked and had to take them on the offer.  I always feel odd taking any sort gestures of appreciation (since I love serving), but the staff was genuinely happy to have us and the burger was terrific. Big thank you to Le Diplomat. You'll continue to have my patronage for the years to come."
5,5,5,5,Great restaurant. My go to for brunch!
4,4,4,5,"The food was great at Le Diplomate, as was the wine list. Portions for 3 of the 4 dishes were substantial, but the scallops were small (bay rather than sea?) and there wasn't much else on the plate to fill up on. The steak, steak frites, and fish were delicious and large servings. We were about 15 minutes late, and the hostess had already cancelled our reservation (despite a phone call the day before confirming the reservation). Luckily, since we were there for an early bird dinner, they still had our table when we arrived! I was a little surprised by the quick cancellation at 5:45pm, when more than half the dining room was still open."
5,5,5,5,"One of the best restaurants we have ever experienced.  But, it is very loud."
5,5,5,5,"Reservation was timely. Waiter was attentive, professional and willing to explain meal choices."
1,3,1,2,"I got seated at the worst table in the restaurant and the wait staff did nothing to make it better. Tons of extraneous staff waiting around doing nothing, but it took forever to order/get our check. Food wasn鈥檛 good enough to put up with horrible service."
5,5,5,5,"The food was delicious, our waiter was attentive and the ambiance was perfect!"
5,5,5,5,Really great food and drinks. We thoroughly enjoyed everything. We made our reservation and were lucky to get the last spot. If you're in the area I would definitely recommend you give it a visit and if you know when you want to go to make a reservation. They are busy and get booked up early.
4,5,5,5,Great experience but the wait was long despite having a reservation
4,4,4,4,"Excellent food, although two of our half dozens oysters were bad/tasted old.  The ambience was nice overall but there was a table of 10-12 girls who were screaming and yelling constantly that the staff neglected to settle down.  Our server was very nice and gave some recommendations about what should be ordered/how much should be ordered but I thought she could have given more information about each dish and what to expect.  The foie Gras was especially tasty and a VERY LARGE PORTION for such a delicacy.  The experience was exceptional overall and I will be returning."
3,3,2,4,The waiter was annoyed to wait on us. The food was fine & ambiance was good. Kind of a dud on our DC food radar.
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely enjoyed the food, ambiance, and the service. Thanks"
5,5,5,5,We go to Le Diplomate every time we visit DC and never disappoints
5,5,5,5,"Great service, food & vibe!  Thx!"
5,5,5,5,Very good all around
5,5,5,5,Consistently one of the best restaurants in Washington. Every dish executed with care and precision. Excellent service from greeting to check.
5,5,5,5,Awesome French Bistro. Great food and great service.
4,4,3,2,Extremely crowded and loud. Authentic French feel. None of the staff was comfortable or familiar with how to treat a solo diner. Drinks were ok. Steak frites was good but pricey for what you get.
5,5,5,5,"Great service, tremendous French cuisine and overall Le Diplomate is an outstanding restaurant"
4,4,3,5,"We loved Le Diplomate.  Some dishes were more successful than others.  All should be great for the price, though!  Loved the menu choices."
3,5,5,5,Wonderful food and excellent service-Le Diplomat has it all. The staff is friendly and helpful; they even hailed a cab for me. I
3,5,5,3,"Food and table service were lovely. However the experience was stressful as we waited a long time for our reserved table, it was crowded so we kept bumping into servers crossing and other waiting guests. Our table itself was fine, but the noise level was horrendous, one of the most uncomfortable I have personally experienced: There were several times I had to cover my ears. Perhaps it鈥檚 the high ceilings and/or the lack of sound insulation, but to make themselves heard over the din, diners spoke even louder, contributing to a vicious escalation of noise. I would return but not till the noise level is addressed by management using creative sound dampening techniques."
5,5,5,5,"Everything was amazing! The service was impeccable, great wine recommendations and food was delicious. Enjoyed eating at one of DC鈥檚 best restaurants."
5,5,5,5,Food was amazing. Great service
5,5,5,5,Service was absolutely delightful! A perfect evening out in DC.
5,5,5,5,Always great!  Love the food and cocktails too!
5,5,3,5,"Food was AMAZING! Atmosphere was cozy and adorable. The vibe was inviting. Perfect for a date night, get together or celebration. Will definitely recommend and go back!"
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic restaurant.  Great vibe, great decoration.  Seemed like more of a local crowd versus tourist which was nice.  Steak Frites were perfect."
4,5,4,4,"We have eaten at Le Dip many times but it remains a favorite. The food is expertly prepared and we have always had great service. The wine list is excllent and the menu does not disappoint. I have had the trout almondine mutiple times and every time, it is absolutely delicious. The chef here makes the most wonderful sauces.  The Steak au poivre is outstanding. That peppercorn sauce is perfection. We often get some of the frites on the side because they are the best I've tasted. Worth every calorie. We also had some Chelsea Gem oysters to start and they were extremely fresh and really delicious.  Excellent dessert menu as well. Don't know how this restaurant maintains such high quality every single time after all these years but they do. Looking forward to returning soon!"
4,5,5,4,I have been hearing rave reviews about Le Diplomate for several years.  It certainly lived up to the reputation that proceeded it.  The Menu was quite authentic French Bistro and very tasty.  The service was excellent and we enjoyed the Sunday Brunch menu.  Next time I will skip the cocktail.  It was disappointing.
1,1,1,3,Sorry but Le Diplomate has totally lost touch. Food is lousy and the service is bad. Do the people receive any training at all ? It is full still because people think that it is a cool place but it seems like it is going down... No more.
5,5,4,5,"Read that this was the place for brunch. It was yummy. We had a bottle of champagne. Perfect! mussels and the duck sarladaise both Devine. I mean it鈥檚 French so not light fare, but worthy of French style."
5,5,5,5,Amazing brunch and breads!!!  We split quite a few different apps and mains with no disappointments.  They are great in handling GF requests.  Management came around checking on things and Tim who was our waiter twice over the weekend did an amazing job.
5,5,5,4,Everything was fantastic. Every morsel of the dishes was perfect. Service was attentive and pleasant. 10/10
5,5,5,5,"Omg. This place is next level. Best grapefruit rosemary cocktail of my life, best goat cheese starter app of my life, best escargot of my life, and steak frites was exceptional. TRES BIEN!!!!! I will come back here as often as possible. Thank you thank you!"
3,3,3,3,"I have been here several times before. I found the place to be too noisy- open table should offer too noisy as an option rather than energeticWhen I asked about the burger the waitress said I couldn't specify a temp since they were thin and the steak frites could only be medium since it was hanger steak and chewy-based on that I just ordered pate, onion soup and wine, and gougeres to go. the gougeres were actually very salty."
5,5,5,5,It was great from start to finish!
5,5,5,5,"I hadn't been to Le Vallauris in close to 20 years.  It was as wonderful as I remembered it...the food, the ambiance, the staff.  In fact, many of the staff were still there, from my last visit, which speaks volumes about the quality of the ownership/management."
5,5,5,5,Fabulous Birthday Dinner in every way!
5,5,5,4,Always a warm welcome w relaxed service.  Beautifully prepared food. The setting is a rare treat.
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful food, impeccable service, and a beautiful setting. Expensive, but worth every penny."
5,5,5,5,Beautiful environment with very good friendly service and delicious food. Be ready to pay for it.
5,5,5,5,Great food and service. Really nice setting for dinner outside under the lights.
5,5,5,5,Just perfect!!
5,5,5,5,Birthday dinner for wife was spectacular.
5,5,5,5,"Always a highlight of our desert stays. The prettiest outdoor dining patio in the desert, and maybe California. The food and service never disappoints. Getting a greeting from the owner who still famously walks from table to table to say hello.Old school charm with unsurpassed standards and quality keep this gem glowing maintaining the top French resturant in the desert."
5,5,5,5,This is one of our favorite restaurants!  They are the absolute best!
5,5,5,5,"We were at Le Vallauris for four reasons: 1) it is a safe bet for variety and quality of the food and drinks, 2) we enjoy the mixture of Euro-American culture at its best, 3) we wanted to invite very good friends for a goodbye dinner and 4) it was our anniversary in Palm Springs. With high expectations it couldn鈥檛 be but Le Vallauris. All of that turned out perfect. A big thank you to the kind staff, to the owner who took time to speak with us and to the beautiful surroundings where we enjoyed a special evening."
5,5,5,5,Always a pleasure. Always lovely with our young family.
4,4,4,5,"This was our first time dining at Le Vallauris and overall we were very happy with our meal, the atmosphere and the service.  Two people in our party picked the larger menu option, one the smaller menu option and one ordered a la carte.  Everything was very good but the dessert on the smaller menu was the most bizarre thing I have ever eaten.  It was described as a rice pudding with exotic fruit but the consistency was particularly odd.  I love rice pudding but they chopped the fruit into tiny squares and it just didn't mix well with the rice pudding consistency since it was all mixed together and the overall dish tasted strange.  Clearly their pastry chef was trying to do something different but sadly he/she did not succeed and instead of ending the meal on a high note it ended just the opposite."
5,5,5,5,"Always impressive!  This is truly a gem with incredible food, outstanding service and a beautiful courtyard to dine under the trees and the stars.  Magical."
5,5,5,5,My favourite restaurant in Palm Springs. Scores high in my book across the board.
5,5,5,5,"In a league of its own, Le Vallauris offers a combination of nostalgia, romance, an excellent menu (and kitchen), and flawless service. Moreover, it's apparent that everyone on site is dedicated to pleasing every guest. Le Vallauris is a wonderful restaurant, but, even more, it is a venerable ""institution."""
5,5,5,5,This is our favorite "go to" celebration spot.  Everything about it is perfect including the host!  Thank you for always making us feel special!
5,5,5,5,Wonderful  as always. the best restaurant in Palm Springs with a cadre of long service staff who look after guests every need . Fabulous food x
4,3,5,5,Our meal was lovely and service was excellent.  Our only complaint came with our entrees.  Mine was not very flavorful (veal) and my friend's was close to inedible (monkfish).  Which was a shocker because everything else on the table was wonderful.  I would definitely try this restaurant again to see if we caught them on a bad night.
4,4,3,5,"Beautiful setting with some nicely prepared dishes, namely the vichyssoise and the lobster ravioli."
5,5,5,5,Utterly delightful.  Old Palm Springs at its best.
5,5,5,5,"Perfect place for special dinners. Welcoming, gracious, great menu.  Staff is professional and very attentive without being intrusive."
4,4,5,5,I鈥檓 the service was outstanding and the ambiance was lovely for our anniversary. I was expecting to be wowed and the food was good but just not what I expected for the price.
5,5,5,5,"We were given a gift certificate to Le Vallauris so used it for my husband's birthday.  Probably wouldn't have gone otherwise because of the prices.  We are so glad we did, though.  For someone of modest means it is a super place for a special occasion.  The atmosphere, food and service are fantastic.  Our server, Mark was friendly, helpful, and took the time to answer any questions we had, whether about the food or the restaurant.  His recommendations were perfect.  If we had the means, this would become a regular treat for us.  As it is, we will be sure to use Le Vallauris for special occasions in the future.  We highly recommend!"
5,5,5,5,Great patio wonderful food and service.
5,5,5,5,Unrivaled experience in a beautiful courtyard. Service was outstanding. The food even more so.
5,5,5,5,Great. I highly recommended this restaurant. Great service and food.
4,4,4,5,Some of the food was not as warm as expected.
5,5,5,5,Always the best!
4,5,5,5,"The food and service were exceptional.  I was very disappointed that we could not be seated on the patio.  The waiter told us we had to request that when we made our reservations.  Open Table did NOT indicate this.  They have a very extensive wine list and the selection is amazing but pricey. I bought my own bottle in and the corkage fee was $85.00!  $85.00!!!  The restaurant was fabulous, the food and service were fantastic.  I just hate surprises and would have  liked to know about requesting the patio and would suggest they put something on their website about the corkage fee."
5,5,5,5,Anniversary dinner.  Always a great time
5,5,5,5,As always Le Vallauris provided excellent food and service. Special thanks for Christine and Bruce for the exceptional service. We were very pleased to see new appetizers as well as the new Mumm champagne.
5,5,5,5,My wife and i are celebrating our 60th anniversary in two weeks and while we were staying in palm desert we went to le Vallauris We couldn鈥檛 have picked a better place
5,5,5,5,It was great!
3,4,5,5,"Food and service overall was very good and satisfying.  I am cursed, however........no matter what restaurant I go to, I always end up near a bunch of loud, inconsiderate patrons.  Such was the case this evening at this restaurant.  When we first arrived, we had a most ideal table.  About 15 minutes after our arrival, while we were beginning our appetizers, a group a six were seated at the next table.  As I said, they were loud and inconsiderate.  It sort of put a damper on everything to follow for us that evening.  Moreover, they were the only loud party in the entire outdoor room.  If it weren't for those rude people, the experience would have been the very best."
5,5,5,5,"Always a singular experience! There is NOTHING like Le Vallauris. It is the best of OLD Palm Springs and we never miss the chance to go when we're in town. The service is bespoke, the terrace courtyard setting is divine and the food is sumptuous. We are so grateful to the owners and managers for the warm greetings and for continuing this fabulous tradition."
5,5,5,5,"Recommended by a friend for special birthday lunch and it was excellent. Food, venue, service were all fantastic!!  Bon app茅tit indeed!"
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food, certainly the best we have tasted in Palm Springs. Polished, old-school service. We were made to feel very welcome"
5,4,5,5,"The ambiance is spectacular. Being outside with the trees and the lighting was such a beautiful experience and wonderful surprise when entering the restaurant. The service was equally outstanding and we had great interactions with hosts and servers who were very engaging, charming and knowledgeable. The food was delicious and we enjoyed all dishes but will say the Lobster Ravioli was a stand out. It was an incredibly enjoyable dining experience."
5,5,5,5,"We go to our anniversary dinner here every year. We have never been disappointed with the quality of the food, service or staff. Staff is very knowledgeable with the menu items and when asked offer good suggestions for food."
5,5,5,5,Very nice ambience and great food! Amanda was our server and she could not have been better!
5,5,5,5,Outstanding as always! The meal and service were wonderful.
5,5,5,5,"Another truly enjoyable meal at Linwoods. Our server, Holly, was excellent - remembered us from previous visits - friendly and attentive - making sure everything was perfect.  Our food was delicious - prepared as requested, not and delicious! One of our favorite restaurants! Highly recommend!"
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful birthday lunch for a friend! Sister was our server- and we love her!!! She is fantastic!!!!  I would like to suggest adding another lunch salad for winter. Maybe something with apples, nuts, chicken, ......We really enjoyed the salad that was on there last and was taken off."
5,5,5,5,Service excellent and not overdone. The guys liked their onion soup and hamburgers. We girls felt the same about the Brussels sprouts and Caesar salads . The stuffed ravioli with mushrooms with the butter sauce fab . A piece of the s鈥檓ores cake with candle a nice birthday touch for one of the guys.
5,5,5,5,"We've eaten at some of the best restaurants around the world, and the meal we recently had at Linwoods might be the best we've ever had. We've actually eaten at Linwoods multiple times before, but not in the past couple of years. Our experience at Linwoods has always been great, but this most recent meal was one for the record books!"
3,3,3,3,"We have always loved Linwoods, however, sometimes the service can be a little uneven.  We had to wait 15 minutes for our table (with reservation), and the service was very slow. My beet salad was just fair- the beets were a bit hard, and I couldnt find the goat cheese.  It also seems the portion size has gone down- and I'm not a big eater"
5,4,5,5,"We are big fans and dine with you often. We brought two of our friends for dinner and they loved it as well. Our favorite server and we closed the place down. A few hiccups with the food coming out, but as delicious as always."
5,5,5,5,Perfect in every way. Everyone loved their meal. Never disappoints. Can鈥檛 wait to go back!
5,5,5,5,Our dinner was perfect!  On this night we just wanted something light. Linwood鈥檚 makes an amazing pizza!  We love to sit on the Grill line and talk to the chef鈥檚!  Annie our server is always on point!  She can anticipate your every need!
5,5,5,5,"A surprise gem of a restaurant!  Truly a fantastic dining experience.  Nothing was missed.  The food is exceptional - rivals the quality, taste, and presentation of any world class restaurant.  The menu has fantastic variety.  And the overall experience is a 'ten'.  I highly recommend."
4,4,4,5,Always an enjoyable experience! Great food & ambiance!
5,5,5,4,"Food and service were excellent, it was a bit noisy but not objectionable. Food was outstanding fairly priced wine list. We'll be back"
5,5,5,5,Always perfect
5,5,5,5,"Great food, great service, lively atmosphere.  I would however call the noise level louder than ""energetic.""  But otherwise a pretty perfect place for dinner."
5,5,5,5,"Consistently great.  Food, service and atmosphere are ideal most any occasion."
4,5,4,5,"Delicious food, nice ambiance.  Service was a little slow for lunch"
5,5,5,5,Always the best!
5,5,5,5,Always consistent !
5,5,5,5,Linwood's is consistently outstanding.  They deliver a superior product time and time again.
5,5,5,5,Always excellent and our server is always perfect.
5,5,4,5,"Linwood鈥檚 is always excellent, and yesterday鈥檚 lunch was no exception!  My friend and I each ordered the lunch special with the petite filet..  I ordered crab soup instead of the salad or soup of the day as I am gluten and lactose free.  My only complaint is that the crab soup was very thick , more like a thick stew.  Very little broth! That was surprising as your crab soup is usually excellent.  It, of course, included plenty of jumbo lump crab on top.  Our server, Kevin, was excellent ( as he always is) , and we were also impressed with Kamala, who was working with Kevin as a trainee.  She will be an excellent server."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful experience with fantastic service!  Thank you for making our work dinner a special event.
5,5,5,3,"Loved the food , worth the price. The noise level was horrible , our table was very close to other tables and we could hear the laughter and conversations of others. In the end we couldn't even hear our voices for conversation. Tables being far apart from each other would be helpful and would make the dinner more enjoyable."
4,5,5,5,"We had great tasting food and combinations.  The squash soup was tremendous.  The appetizer was excellent- mushrooms, cheese, and ravioli.  The desert was the bees knees- pecan tart w ice cream was impeccable.  Always glad when Linwood checks on us during the meal.  Pleasant experience."
3,4,4,4,"The food and service was good, but it has definitely declined since last time we dined there earlier this year.  Hopefully it was an off night."
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding food, quality of service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive, helpful and patient with a hard-of-hearing family member!  Loved my meal and experience!!"
5,5,5,5,"Awesome food. Very attentive service. Never had less than a superb experience, ever."
5,5,5,4,Annie is a excellent server. Food is consistently great.
5,5,5,5,We ate outside. The food was great
5,5,5,5,Linwood鈥檚 is by far the best restaurant in Baltimore.... the food is just spectacular and in all my years I have never had a bad meal there. Consistency personified.
4,4,5,2,"SUPERB service and decent food, but a bit on the pricey and stuffy side for me."
4,5,4,4,Excellent choice for fine dining in Owings Mills.  Food is always exceptional.
5,5,5,5,Everything was great!
5,5,5,5,"wonderful food, terrific service, always a pleasure to dine there."
5,5,5,5,"This is my second time coming to this restaurant and I love it. The atmosphere is very much local but upscale. Hostess and servers always go above and beyond, give wonderful compliments and check on us frequently. Also the steak is amazing."
2,2,1,3,Salmon was undercooked-service was very sketchy-pizza was burned  and blah
5,5,5,5,The food and service was top notch and I would highly recommend Linwood鈥檚
5,5,5,5,The food is always exceptional and the service was too! We love it there!
5,5,5,5,Outstanding as usual!!!!  Food is consistently amazing and service was impeccable!  Annie is one of the BEST servers at Linwood鈥檚!  The out door dining is always perfect on on a nice evening!
5,5,5,5,"It was such a nice dining!We dropped by this place on the way to Haleakala, and it was just a perfect plan!You meed to visit this place if youre first to Maui"
5,5,4,5,"If you find yourself in Maui, this is THE place to go... their mahi-mahi stuffed crab entree is our favorite .... highly recommend this place!"
5,5,5,5,Special for sure. Expensive but the whole experience was worth every penny!
5,5,5,5,Birthday celebration
5,5,5,5,"We had a wonderful experience here and can not wait to come back!!! The service was so lovely- friendly, attentive, easy- going and very knowledgeable with suggestions!  The food was sublime! Literally every point from start to finish met or exceeded all expectations!! Every drink, appetizer, main, and desert was so very very good. The complimentary bread and soup were excellent as well.  We just could not have been more pleased with our time there!!"
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful experience. The drinks, the food and the service are all excellent. The restaurant and grounds are beautiful."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely amazing!
5,5,5,5,"Although we received numerous glowing recommendations for your restaurant from many of our friends that have visited Maui, nothing could have prepared us for the actual experience.It's a magical spot on the Hana highway that oozes charm.Our server Heather was AMAZING and all of the staff were friendly and accommodating.As for the food and cocktails.... every dish was just awesome.From appetizers through dessert, each dish one was not only a visual work of art, but well thought out and a balanced cornucopia of flavors. Coming from NYC, we're generally accustomed to good food, and Mamas Fish House delivered on the highest level.Definitely worth the price!!!"
5,5,5,5,Was super!!!!
5,5,5,5,Honeymoon. Great service and atmosphere
5,5,5,5,A wonderful family dinner by the ocean.
5,5,5,5,Very friendly staff . Great food ! Will be back again
5,5,5,5,Number one restaurant on Maui for breathtaking scenery and food. Service is always spectacularly and the fish is so fresh and prepared perfectly. They pay special attention to you if you are celebrating an anniversary or birthday!  You feel special from the moment you walk in tyour when you leave!
5,5,5,5,Most amazing dining experience! We have celebrated all of our family milestone & special celebrations here over the last 20 years. Has the feel of old authentic Hawaii and charm combined with fresh updated menu. Never disappointed.
5,5,5,5,As always.. a very special place. Excellent food and great service.  Not to mention the view and ambiance
5,5,5,5,"Delicious food, awesome setting, valet parking was a nice treat."
5,5,5,5,"Beautiful grounds, excellent food and service! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
5,5,5,5,Excellent atmosphere with beautiful views! Excellent food! A must!
5,5,5,5,Absolutely marvelous!
5,5,5,5,"I think that the prices at Mama's are exorbitant.  The food was good but I have had equally good food at five start restaurants for about 25-30%less.  I think the hype about Mama's is not warranted.  Would I recommend to a friend?  Depends.  If the friend doesn't mind the pricey food then yes.  Otherwise, you could get equally good meals for less.  We were lucky in that we were the first there so we had probably the best seats in the house for two people.  A wonderful ocean view. We went because our realtor gave us a gift certificate because he thought we should have the experience.  We have been coming to Maui for many years and when people on the mainland heard that we had never been to Mama's they couldn't believe it - even though they had never been themselves.  Again - good hype and good marketing.  Amazing."
5,5,5,5,Best meal I have ever had. Seriously. Spendy but well worth it. The restaurant itself is breathtaking.
5,5,5,5,"This was a great experience for a first timer to Maui. I am person who does not like the taste of fish or crab/lobster. I ordered the stuffed fish and I have to be honest it had no tasted of fish, I mentioned this to the waiter and he stated that the fish taste only comes from non-fresh fish, as Mama鈥檚 Fish House only uses fresh caught fish, crab, and lobster it does not have that taste.  I highly recommend this place and the stuffed fish."
5,5,5,5,Beautiful setting with outstanding food
5,5,5,5,impeccable
5,5,5,5,Impressive!  Definitely 5 star restaurant in Hawaii.
5,5,5,5,"Phenomenal dining experience.  Attentive and informative service.  Ambience was magnificent.  Food was beyond  exceptional - every appetizer and entree.  Mama鈥檚 was highly recommended to us, but exceeded our expectations!"
5,5,5,5,Exceptional service and food!! We were celebrating our Anniversary and had a splendid experience. Make sure to try the Mai Tai when you visit...Cheers!!
5,5,5,5,"We loved our good, table and outstanding service.We had a ball.Andrea and Bob Freeman"
5,5,5,5,Hands down one of the best sea food restaurants I鈥檝e been to.  My advice would be to get the fresh caught fish as it is very tender. The drinks and desert was also very tasty.
5,5,5,5,This is a very special place.
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely stellar dining experience. My spouse and I came here after reading rave reviews. We got a lunch reservation at 11:15 a week out and our table was at the front of the restaurant with a gorgeous view of the ocean. From the moment you arrive at Mama鈥檚, you鈥檙e having an excellent experience. We were promptly met by a valet who parked our car, and walked down a gorgeous beach path to the restaurant. The lobby even had amazing ambiance and smelled like tropical flowers.Our waiter was casual and friendly, and had tons of tips about the area and the menu. They were able to custom make us nonalcoholic beverages. We ate the mushrooms and ceviche as a starter. Both were light and delicious. The ceviche in particular was perfectly prepared. Every element packed flavor, and the flavors were balanced and harmonious.I ordered the Mama鈥檚 stuffed fish, and my spouse ordered the onaga. Both of our filets were perfectly cooked and moist. The macadamia crust on my filet sealed in moisture and added a wonderful crispy texture. It was even paired with a small cut of lobster tail across the top that was still moist and cooked to the perfect delicate texture, bursting in the mouth, not at all chewy.For dessert, we split the day鈥檚 sorbet. The presentation was gorgeous and the sorbet was packed with fresh fruit flavor, coconut lime and guava. I loved every bite of this meal, well worth the price, and really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the restaurant. We never felt rushed, and staff were everywhere, ready to make sure we were well attended to and comfortable. A lot of fine restaurants will try to get you out the door, but mama鈥檚 felt focused on making sure you were having the best time you could while you were there.Having a beach front table welcomed a little more noise, but the people watching was so fun, and the view was unbeatable. Definitely make this a stop on your trip."
5,5,5,5,From the view to the service to the impeccable food...this place is a must! The restaurant is charming. The food is outstanding and the service is off the charts!
5,5,5,5,"I enjoyed the food, the ambiance, the service.  Everything was very special and we defiantly will be back for all of our special occasions."
5,5,5,5,Mamas is the BEST food on the island. We had the stuffed fish and the curry and both were SO delicious! The atmosphere is unbeatable and the service was great as well. A must do in Maui!
1,1,1,4,"Seated 35 minutes after reservation, and server was more interested in managing her 8 top than keeping up with us. Drinks ran dry after about 15 minutes and she never offered a second round, never asked how our meal was until plates were taken away by bus team.  Overall, not worth the $. Go to the Mill House instead for better views, food, and service."
5,5,5,5,A must do when in Maui . You will not be disappointed.
5,5,5,5,We had been told by several people not to miss dinner at Mama's Fish house.  we were only able to get reservations really early but it worked out just fine.  We thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service was excellent and friendly.  I will tell anyone I know going to Maui to be sure to get to Mama's whatever time is available.
5,5,5,5,Great dinner in a beautiful spot. Drinks we awesome and the food was even better
5,5,5,5,Best seafood meal we鈥檝e ever had. We visited 15 years ago and remembered how nice it was so had to come back.  Glad we saved it for our last meal on the island. Did not disappoint. Learned a lot from Dave at the Bar. He was very friendly and had a lot of knowledge of Mama鈥檚.  Thank you!!
4,4,3,5,"We have been to Mama's a couple times and this time something felt off. The food was good, but the service felt very impersonal and rushed. Maybe it was our waitress having an off day, but it was disappointing."
5,5,5,5,The signature Chicken under a brick is truly excellent and the portion is very generous.  The service was very good.  The ambiance is casual country with lots of wooden tables and bookshelves looking as you imagine a country home.
5,5,5,5,Love this restaurant one of my favorite in the City
5,5,5,5,"We have been lucky enough to celebrate our anniversary with dinner at Marc Forgione鈥檚 for five of the last seven years.  This is our 42nd anniversary, and we were not disappointed. The food was outstanding. Not just great, but totally unexpected and inspiring. The service was also exceptional. From beginning to end, our dinner experience was perfect."
5,5,5,5,"I dined at Marc Forgione with a friend about a month ago and had a great experience. Went back with my family for round two and the experience cemented Marc Forgione as a ""go to"" spot for me.  Great vibe, love the space, wine list with some very good and well-priced selections and our food was fantastic.  The service was stellar as well. We'll be back for sure."
5,5,5,5,Amazing food. Come hungry.
5,5,5,5,"Our first visit to celebrate my sons relocation back to NYC was a hit. Great dining experience all around, food and service. Missed out on the bacon special but we will be back!"
5,5,5,5,Restaurant Marc Forgione is an extraordinary restaurant that offers scrumptious food with perfect delivery.  The staff is both warm and friendly while providing exceptional service. Super cozy (and yet energized) atmosphere.  Our absolute favorite!
5,5,5,5,Food was exceptional.
5,5,5,5,"The evening was wonderful.  Attended with good friends - the staff was very attentive, food was delicious - it was a very fun and enjoyable evening."
3,2,4,4,A big fan of the chicken under brick...the taste and how the dish was served wasn鈥檛 the same as before.
5,5,5,5,Great. Per usual.
5,5,5,5,Just delicious. Expensive but worth it. An experience without a coursed menu.
5,5,5,5,"We鈥檝e been going to Marc Forgione since it opened and was simply called Forge. While prices have certainly gone up and the food has become a little more upscale, what hasn鈥檛 changed is the amazing standards of Forgione鈥檚 cooking and the pleasantly relaxed but romantic atmosphere.  Old staples are still on the menu, like the brick chicken with broccoli and potatoes cooked in the pan juices along with seasonal additions. The wine list is extensive and enticing, but also offers some decent propositions for those on a budget.   Would highly recommend for anything from a quick bite to eat, to a major celebration."
5,5,5,5,Always a great time here. Food and drinks are excellent. Top notch service and very friendly chef and staff. I always recommend this spot to all friends as the place in Tribeca.
5,5,5,5,Excellent as always!
1,1,4,4,The food was not of their standard and too expensive.
5,5,5,5,The food was amazing. After all of these years it still holds up!!!
5,5,5,5,"We did the chef's tasting menu which was fantastic. Also, as I told them it was for a birthday, there was a letter from management on the table when we sat down thanking us! They treated us to complementary glasses of cava as well. Everything from top to bottom(food & service) about the experience was outstanding!"
5,5,5,5,My favorite place
5,5,5,5,Very warm atmosphere and staff. The food is great and flavours very bold. Amazing wine list!
5,5,5,5,"This was our second visit to Marc Forgione. Both were outstanding. The food is excellent, the menu interesting and diverse and the service has been top notch. We look forward to regular visits!"
5,5,5,5,"Once again a fabulous dinner. The service is top notch . Friendly and professional. Chef was in the restaurant , and as always , came to our table several times . He is so creative and talented. We enjoyed some of the new items on the fall menu (mini arancini, Dover sole, two delicious pasta appetizers) as well as our favorites - the halibut and roasted chicken (the best in the city).Can鈥檛 wait to go back next week."
4,5,5,5,great food abd ambiance but the noise level is more than energetic馃檲you simply can鈥檛 hear the other person talking...you only see lips moving馃槼
5,5,5,5,"Delicious food and fabulous friendly service from everyone, including the Chef! We had a very special night celebrating a 40th birthday, starting with great wine and ending with amazing desserts! Can鈥檛 wait to go back!"
5,5,5,5,Fantastic food with wonderful personal touches
5,5,5,5,Very nice servers. Food was excellent as always. Chef Forgione came by our table to see if everyrhing was good.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful creative food and wine. Service was awesome.  Highly recommended.
5,5,5,5,Everything about this meal was amazing
5,5,5,5,Awesome place- great food - great service! Modern American cuisine with some individual touch.
5,5,4,4,Great atmosphere & really delicious food...great menu choices 7 variety!
5,5,5,5,Delightfully friendly and attentive service.
5,5,5,5,"Personalized service. Incredible food - tastes, textures, presentation.The more I ate the more I wanted to taste.  I was satiated but not heavy full.  More than just a quality meal out, this is truly a 鈥渄ining experience鈥."
5,5,5,5,This is my fourth time at Forgione鈥檚. Every time I鈥檓 in New York I make a point to go there. The menu changes constantly but they always manage to amaze me with the quality of the dishes. Every component of the dish has a purpose and is well thought of. This is by far the best restaurant I鈥檝e been to and they never disappoint.
5,5,5,3,It was on my bucket list when I traveled to NYC. I loved it!Everything was delicious!
5,5,5,5,"Attentive, but not obtrusive service, varied menu, great food, and attending to detail made this a delightful anniversary dinner!"
3,3,4,3,Extremely overpriced.
5,5,5,4,Excellent food and servicte . Top marks for Service expecially ... Steak was the best dish and the desserts were my leat favorite. Steak is too expensive (a share order costs $180) and the total cheque was 320 including drinks haha. But I would go back..for the clean service and no frills ambiance
5,5,5,5,They treated us so nicely and made our anniversary so special
5,5,5,4,"Perfection. Food was amazing.  Service impeccable. It was our anniversary.  They had a lively handwritten card at our table and special surprise desert. Kyle , our waiter, probably the best I have ever had. Warm, personable, knowledgeable and perfect recommendations.  We highly recommend."
5,5,5,5,I鈥檓 on this app weekly and Forgione鈥檚 in a top 3 restaurant nationwide.
5,5,5,5,"This is a wonderful restaurant with an excellent staff.  The tasting menu is not fixed.  You decide what you want to eat.  Our waiter really knew wine and picked out the pairings for us taking into account our taste.  The ambiance was great as well, and conversation easy."
5,5,5,5,Anniversary dinner. Very pleased. Great food complemented by great service
5,5,5,5,"Old school charm in a quiet, cozy atmosphere with exceptional service and great food.  Plus, added benefit that it is quiet, so you can hear your dinner companions."
5,5,5,5,Excellent menu with well balanced choices and almost all was gluten free. The service is consistent with a three star Michelin restaurant.
5,5,5,5,I would highly recommend this restaurant. My husband and I had dinner here on a Monday night and it was fabulous. I read several reviews that talked about the small portion size... I strongly disagree with that. We did order the six course tasting menu but were so full we couldn鈥檛 even eat the dessert. Can鈥檛 wait to go back the next time we are in DC.
3,4,2,2,Service was bad and the outlook looks like Halloween relic.
5,5,5,5,"Marcel's is a perfect place for a celebratory dinner and evening--the menu has something for everyone, the wine list is compelling but not all so expensive and the service was just right"
5,5,5,4,"Great service, great food.  Nothing to complain about. Highly recommended."
5,5,4,5,"We selected the pre theatre dinners. Mussels for me, scallop for my husband . Mains were rockfish & filet mignon. Desserts creme br没l茅e & rice pudding. Service is wonderful , food is delicious and ambiance lovely."
5,5,5,5,"Things are always changing at Marcel鈥檚.  No matter how many times you have had lamb, venison, four gras, halibut, or scallops at Marcel, you can be sure of a different and wonderful culinary experience every time you return.  The creativity never rests!"
5,5,5,5,"My go to special occasion and treat restaurant in DC, always a great experience. The maitre de was excellent and the commensurate professional, he looked after us really well. Great fine dining selection with lots of choices. Thank you again."
4,4,3,4,"I have definite mixed feelings.  We started off on a negative note as we sat at our table for at least 20 minutes waiting to order while tables seated at the same time had already received their first course.  It almost felt as if my son and his new wife, my mother and I didn't quite reach the bar in regards to affluence and appreciation of fine dining.  Looks can be deceiving. After that initial wait, the service was great.  The food was beautifully presented and delicious.  In particular, the skate and sole I would recommend.  The foie gras was excellent.  The NY strip was very tender.  The venison chop was cooked perfectly.  The mussel dish was a little disappointing in that there was only one mussel.  This is not a menu for anyone afraid of richness and deep flavors.  Moez was very attentive and helpful with wine selection.  The ambience was perfect.  Would I recommend to a friend?  Probably.  Will I return?  Maybe.  There are so many wonderful options in DC that are in the same tier, and every time I am in town, we go to at least one or two highly rated restaurants.  All in all, a very good restaurant, maybe more of a special occasion dinner for many.  Maybe we'll come back when we are searching for that wonderful French dining experience."
5,4,5,5,The atmosphere is very romantic. The food was outstanding they were very accommodating so we would make our show at 9 we came in at 7pm for a five course meal. The waiter was very classy. Side note valet parking is $15
5,5,5,5,Amazing cuisine and service!
5,5,5,5,"An absolute must visit if you enjoy fine dining and are from the MD. Northern VA. Or DC area. Beautiful place. Every bite was immaculate. My only regret is that the portions were not bigger so I could get more bites in. The wait staff was kind, attentive and wonderful at what they do. The presentation of the food was gorgeous and everything was cooked to perfection. It was an experience."
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic food, amazing service! I can鈥檛 wait for our next visit- Thank you!"
5,5,5,5,Fantastic meal as always.  We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary there (which is a 10+ year tradition) one of our favorite spots in the city.
5,5,5,5,Great service and food especially by Jonathan
5,5,5,5,"First rate. One of the best in Washington, maybe the best. Excellent food excellent service. Quiet, relaxed ambience. Just about perfect."
5,5,5,4,"The four course tasting meal left us full, and impressed with imaginative combinations not tastes and textures in each dish. Service was professional, attentive and fun. We asked our server to select two wines to go with our food: he knew what he was doing and it was a better experience than a bottle from the impressive, and expensive, wine list. The kitchen decorated our desserts with 鈥淗appy Anniversary鈥, a truly celebratory meal ranking with the best of restaurants in France. It was the most expensive meal we鈥檇 ever eaten. This is a special occasion restaurant, and a truly special one. The room was surprisingly quiet despite being nearly full, so you did not feel part of fellow diners鈥 conversations. Tables are spaced for discretion."
5,5,5,5,Marcel鈥檚 never disappoints! Food is superb and service is excellent. Wine recommendations were excellent.One of a few  restaurants where you can enjoy fine dining . Just a special place where you really dress for dinner and be treated like royalty. Thank you for maintaining such high standards.
5,5,5,5,Wonder fine dining experience.
5,5,5,5,So wonderful to be in such a terrific restaurant where people are dressed appropriately and the waiters are dressed.  White table clothes and professional but nice and pleasant service.  You can hear you dinner partner speak without screaming and have a decent conversation.  Wonderful.  We enjoyed it thoroughly!!!!
5,5,5,5,Simply fabulous!!  The pre theater offering is probably the best value in town.  If you judge a restaurant by the chicken it serves Marcel's moves to the top of the list.  Great service.  Wonderful setting. Beautiful presentations.  This is a multi star restaurant deserving of special dates and special friends.
5,5,5,5,"Perfect. From start to finish. From the piano playing quietly in the bar to the wonderful surprises that came out of the kitchen all night long, its exactly how fine dining should be. Cannot wait to go back."
5,5,5,5,This is our favorite resturant for pre theater dining. Vinnie is the best server and the food is fantastic.
5,5,5,5,Outstanding!  This is a restaurant that deserves its two Michelin stars. Our food experience was phenomenal and the wine paired perfectly. It was a very experience dinning experience but overall worth it.
5,5,5,5,"An old standby still operating at the top level.  Delicious food creatively prepared.  Service at a level of professionalism few other restaurants (even ""fine"" ones) can match.  The timing between courses was a little more leisurely than ideal on a busy Saturday night, but not enough to drop a star off the otherwise outstanding service."
5,5,5,5,"Truly an awesome meal! Flavors are complex, yet delicate. Service is extraordinary and wine list is very focused to go with anything on the menu."
5,5,5,5,"Classic European at very high level. Not especially reasonable, but these type of places rarely are. But what you get for the money is absolutely brilliant."
5,5,5,5,It's always a pleasure to go to Marcel's.  The food is outstanding in taste and presentation.  The wait staff is excellent and we are always made to feel welcome for returning.  I wished I lived closer so that I could go more often.
5,5,5,5,Superb in all aspects. Pricey but worth it. Can鈥檛 get any better. Our favorite special occasion restaurant.
4,4,5,5,Wonderful service and ambiance but the food while good was not memorable. Two dishes were too salty and apricot soup dessert was barely average.
3,5,5,2,"Portions are way too small. These make small plates look big and would be too small even if labeled as a tasting menu. Wiedmaier is a great chef, the food is divine, service on a par. But why so stingy? The cost of the food has to be the least after overhead, staff, etc. so why not double the size and charge $10 more for prix fixe. This fetish over preciousness is passe. Wake up. Restaurant won't be here much longer judging by empty tables our night."
5,5,5,5,Excellent service in a nice setting.
5,5,4,4,"Back to Marcel's to try the a la carte tasting menu. Filled will all sorts of tasty small dishes, with some emphasis on seafood. Everything is beautifully presented and they are flexible in letting you mix and max four, five, or six courses. Service very good and the main dining room is quite lovely. It probably does not get any better in downtown Washington. A treat!"
5,5,4,4,Wonderful restaurant in the heart of Washington. Valet service @ $15 gives you a free shuttle to the Kennedy Center and back. Perfect for early dining and a show. They have a pre-theater prix fixe at $72 which is a very good value. Excellent choices and quality. Attentive service. Lovely dining room. This is at the top of the D.C. food chain.
5,5,5,5,Fantastic... Great service.
5,5,4,4,"Marcel's is a very special (and very expensive) restaurant that's perfect for special occasion meals or just when you want a blow-out evening with food that will astonish your palate.  Small plates are the main attraction, you may choose 6, 5, or 4.  A 3-course pre-theater menu is also available with larger ""entree"" portions.  Whatever you choose, you can't go wrong.  Each dish is extraordinary and memorable.  The setting is lovely with lots of fabric-covered finishes to damped the sound and the service is first rate.  Truly a DC institution, this restaurant is among the finest not only in the city but likely anywhere fine dining is available."
5,5,5,5,Celebrating anniversary at a restaurant that matched the significance of the occasion.
5,5,5,4,Just a consistently great Italian restaurant. You can't go wrong here.
5,5,5,5,It was our anniversary and they surprised us with a complimentary dessert with a happy anniversary sign!
5,5,5,5,Best restaurant in nyc
5,5,5,5,My favorite restaurant in New York.
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I really enjoyed this experience. We had lunch, and the meal was very good, service outstanding"
5,5,5,5,Wonderful on all levels!
5,5,5,5,Fabulous Italian restaurant deserving of its two Michelin Stars!  We will definitely come back!
5,5,5,5,Excellent food and service. Marea is a must stop place for me everytime I come to NY.
4,5,4,4,Great food and service
5,5,5,5,Anniversary. And after theater.  Exceptional.
5,5,5,5,Absolutely great food and service.  Wine steward was very helpful and picked 2 great Barbaresco鈥檚 in our price range.The Fuselli pasta with octopus and bone marrow is a MUST.Can鈥檛 wait to return.
5,5,5,5,"Always a great experience there, especially for any special occasion!"
5,5,5,5,Outstanding food and service as always. A class act.
5,5,5,5,Now one of my top five restaurants in the world. Everything was near perfect or better
5,5,5,5,"Elegant, quiet, wonderful service鈥擲uperb Italian pasta鈥攚ell informed servers, non-intrusive, superb place to talk to someone and really have a great meal while doing it.$200 for two people for lunch鈥擶orth it."
5,5,5,5,Excelente as always. Every time we come to town we go there for dinner. Kept doing it for the last 6 years. Always great
3,2,2,4,Very disappointed in our service. Our waiter had an attitude and impossible to get him or someone else to take a wine order. The tuna crudo with oyster crema and artichoke had absolutely no flavor and nothing on it and no oyster crema. I haven't been in a number of years and can now see why they lost one of their two Michelin stars.
4,5,5,5,"Food is excellent, but the prices are outpacing inflation. Now it has crossed a line and is too expensive."
5,5,5,3,Sara鈥檚 celebration
5,5,5,5,"This is by far the best seafood restaurant in NYC, and maybe the East Coast.  Lovely setting, not pretentious, every dish a delight, topped off with excellent service. Le Bernardin doesn鈥檛 hold a candle to Marea!"
5,5,5,5,Just Amazing! Loved it from beginning to end! Just Amazing!
4,5,4,5,Our waiter was fantastic and the food was sublime.
5,5,5,5,Always perfect!
5,5,5,5,The food and service was amazing
5,5,5,5,Amazing dinner with my husband.
5,3,4,4,Nice vibe. Celebrities often go there
5,5,5,5,Really truly lovely. Excellent meal.
5,5,5,5,"My husband and I ate here as our last meal in NYC. It was absolutely amazing. We had the octopus and the lobster burrata first corse and the halibut and the fusilli second course. All of it was an explosion of flavor. The server was kind and knowledgeable, he made recommendations and we could tell he was passionate about the food. We will definitely return to Marea next time we鈥檙e in the city!"
5,5,5,5,"Great service,Wonderful desert wine selection,Will definitely return"
3,4,3,4,"For a 2 Michelin star restaurant, I was a little disappointed as I would鈥檝e expected better service and an outstanding experience. I鈥檝e experienced much better service and overall experiences at restaurants that don鈥檛 actually have any Michelin stars. Ex. Loring Place and Alo in Toronto."
5,5,5,5,Very nice meal without being too stuffy or stilted. Duck ravioli was superb!  Also loved the signature cocktails.  Highly recommend
5,5,5,5,"Es la mejor comida italiana que he probado fuera de de Italia, 2 estrellas Micheline"
5,5,5,5,"Epic!! One of NYC鈥檚 finest. Wonderful food, wine and service. Excellent sommelier team."
5,5,5,5,Comida y servicio m谩s all谩 de lo que esperaba en un ambiente incre铆ble. S煤per recomendable
5,5,5,5,The crab pasta was so good I ate half my partner鈥檚 plate. My own scallops were also very good.
5,5,5,5,"Extensive wine list by the glass.  We were there after theatre, but did not feel rushed. Had the squash antipasto and it was wonderful.  Pastas were delicious.  It was a great late night choice"
5,5,5,5,Lobster ravioli was great!!
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, atmosphere and service. The best fine seafood restaurant I鈥檝e been to in this city (and I鈥檓 born and raised in NYC)."
5,5,5,5,"I have been going to Marea for several years and is amazing how they keep their magic going.  We order crudos, astice (lobster burrata), fusilli with red wine braised octopus and bone marrow and some langoustines, everything was outstanding."
5,5,5,5,"I could not be more pleased. The food was wonderful, and the staff could not have been nicer or more attentive. Exceptional experience."
5,5,5,5,Very innovating dishes with great taste. You won't get bored here. There is something for everybody and all dishes are expertly prepared. Great wine list and exceptional service. Well run machine
4,5,3,4,Food was outstanding maybe as good as I have every had and that includes the French Laundry.  Service was not as good as the food a little slow.
5,5,4,5,"Service was a bit slower than previous visits and entres took longer than expected (based on experience at Market) to come out of the kitchen. Food was, as always, excellent. My wife's gluten allergy was forgotten (waiter asked when we arrived as they always do) when the restaurant brought out a cake based desert to celebrate our aniversary - somebody  dropped the ball."
5,5,5,4,One of the best meals I鈥檝e had. Creative dishes. Friendly attentive wait staff.
5,5,5,4,We went to Market to celebrate my wife's birthday. Market is one of our favorite restaurants. The food is always great. The decor of the restaurant is lacking (needs a refresh) but the food is amazing. We both did the tasting menu and I have to tell you it ranks up there with the few times I've eaten at Addison. Since the portions are bigger at Market I would say it was my best dining experience in the 5 years we have lived in San Diego. We will certainly visit again but really wish they gave the place a face lift.
5,5,5,5,Great meal.  Food was excellent.
4,5,4,3,The unpleasant part of this evening for me was that the A/C was blowing directly on my shoulders all evening long and there was no way of getting away from it. And believe me I always love A/C everywhere I go.
4,4,4,5,"The 鈥渃omplimentary valet鈥 is a confusing concept... you still want to tip the valet, but who carries cash these days? So just be prepared to bring cash so you can tip the valet.Hostess was not warm, as a hostess should be. However, the waiters were exceptional! Thank you. Very friendly. I don鈥檛 think management should require them to memorize specials of the day, as it comes across very rehearsed, awkward, and off-putting. Save them the embarrassing stress & just write it on a simple menu card. I love a dark, cozy ambiance & this place is that exactly. The food was good but I noticed on the tasting menu the same base sauces and ingredients were repeated a few times. If you don鈥檛 like salmon, don鈥檛 order the trout... it tastes identical. The Cabernet braised short rib was insanely delicious. I was accidentally given a restaurant week menu & the manager was kind enough to honor the discounted prices on the menu I was presented with. Thank you. Very generous gesture.Some of the side panel wood near my table was very dusty (attention to cleanliness details always appreciated), and there were a few annoying gnats buzzing around that I had to keep swatting away & this interfered with my relaxed dining mood."
5,5,5,4,Always an amazing experience eating at Market. Food is truly awesome!!
5,5,5,5,Just outstanding. The food is the best in town.
5,5,5,4,"Market is in my top two restaurants in San Diego! Always delicious, service is great, a fabulous experience. My only wish is that some of the tables were a little bit further apart so we don't hear every word of the conversation next to us. Of course, this will not keep us from returning again and again for Chef Schroeder's amazing cuisine!"
5,5,5,5,We are never disappointed. The food is amazing matched only by the service.
3,2,3,4,Food was salty. Our main dish came late.  I will not come back again. It's our 2nd time here.
5,5,5,4,PROBABLY THE BEST RESTAURANT WE HAVE VISITED IN SAN DIEGO...AND WE HAVE VISITED QUITE A FEW.  FOOD WAS JUST OUTSTANDING!  WOULD LIKE IT EVEN BETTER IF IT WAS A BIT LESS EXPENSIVE.
3,3,5,4,"I really think the food is way too salty. Too saucy, drenched in sauce, to be honest.If you claim to use great ingredients, let the flavor shine through."
5,5,5,4,"This is one the few restaurants in San Diego that we go to if we want a special treat.  We partook of the SD Restaurant Week menu and it was outstanding, beautifully plated and wonderful flavors.  No skimping on quality.  The waiter was respectful and knowledgeable.  Highly recommend."
4,4,4,4,"We were impressed by the way you creat each dish- subtle but colorful balance of the well chosen ingredients! Particularly blue cheese souffl茅. Only one disappointment was the beef for the main- it was a little too salty and was the sauce, too. Other than that all great and we will come back in future."
5,5,5,4,"脺ber Jahre hinweg konsistent bestes Restaurant in San Diego. Wir wurden noch nie entt盲uscht. Immer innovativ, wunderbare Zutaten und wunderbaren Kreationen. Service regelm盲脽ig ausgezeichnet. Gro脽es Restaurant mit vielen G盲sten und trotzdem logistisch perfekt organisiert."
4,5,5,5,"Dinner for 4 during restaurant week.  Arrived a bit early waited at the bar and were seated promptly at the reservation time.  The dining room is set up nicely and (kudos) for once no stupid tables.  The place was busy but the noise level moderate!!  Food overall was excellent - an interesting take on a tuna tartar,  excellent corn soup with smoked port.  Entr茅es were trout, duck and beef tenderloin - all very well prepared - portions very adequate.  Desserts yummy.  Attentive, efficient and polite service!!!!Bar selection OK - not really great and along with the wine list insanely overpriced.  A clear indication that they are catering to the Rancho Santa Fe crowd. In all a very enjoyable evening and will visit again when in the area"
5,5,5,5,We really enjoyed the food and the service was excellent. We will return for next restaurant week.
5,5,5,5,"Ate off the restaurant menu with wine pairing.  Great food, and our waiter was outstanding.  Expensive, but still great value."
5,5,5,5,Always love Market and this was no exception. Delicious.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food and service, as always at this gem of a restaurant!"
5,4,5,5,"Have eaten here many times... thought the food was heavy on the salt as did everyone else.  Two meals were fish, two were beef.  This has never occurred before.  We were disappointed as the the food has always been perfectly seasoned...the desserts and wine pairings were wonderful."
5,5,5,5,Our favorite restaurant in San Diego! The food was and is always amazing. Service is top notch!
5,5,5,5,"Loved the atmosphere , food, service. They鈥檙e truly professional . Enough waiters so you don鈥檛 feel left out. My favorite 馃槃馃憤"
5,5,5,5,"Simple put, there is no other restaurant like Market. The food is always delicious and unique. Its our favorite place to dine."
4,4,5,5,Restaurant week and date night. All was amazing but the tenderloin was too salty. The wine pairing was great. The green apple sorbet and berry dessert were amazing. The pear salad was to die for!
5,5,5,5,"We dined during Restaurant Week and had a great experience.  Nice selection of starters, entrees and deserts.  Our waiter was terrific.  The wine pairings were not quite as well paired as in the past, but were still interesting.  Of course, we'll keep coming back to this marvelous restaurant."
5,5,5,5,Perfect and delicious
5,5,5,5,Birthday - was wonderful!
5,5,5,5,"Best restaurant in the San Diego area. The freshest ingredients, exquisite on the palate, awesome wines.....Market has it all!"
4,3,5,4,Went to the Market for my wife鈥檚 birthday - overall an enjoyable evening.  We started with the corn soup (great) and burrata cheese & peach salad (good) - we then shared the forest mushroom ravioli (good but incredibly rich & salty) and the grilled beef tenderloin/lobster combo - the tenderloin was again much too salty.  Both my wife and I left with a lingering salty aftertaste and told the waiter as much.  The waiter was very attentive & we appreciated the birthday dessert - just cut back on the copious amounts of salt.
5,5,5,5,Great staff and food!
5,5,5,4,great neighborhood favorite. we order the market salad (off the menu).the fig salad was very good.duck special was excellent.
5,5,5,5,"Good service and staffs, Amazing cuisine!"
5,5,5,5,We had a delicious meal.  Party of four and we each ordered a different app and entree so that we could try a variety of menu items.  Everything was wonderful. Best meal we鈥檝e had in a long time.
5,5,4,4,Food here is ALWAYS amazing!!!We did not love our server this visit though... she was below par the others we have had in past visits.We will absolutely return... just hope to have a different server that鈥檚 a true representation of this fine dining establishment.
5,5,5,4,My favorite restaurant..Recommend it to all my friends
5,5,5,5,Perfect in every way!
5,5,5,5,"One of the best restaurants in Los Angeles.  Classic French food, superb service...every item was fresh and delicious.....you cannot go wrong on Mistral....they even brought me a Chocolate Souffle on my b-day!"
5,5,5,5,Great as always
3,3,5,4,"My wife and I dined here recently for our 46th wedding anniversary.Service was very good and people were very friendly, but 3 things stood out to us as kind of odd.1.  When we drove up to the restaurant, there was a valet waiting.  However, there was a metered parking space available toward the front of the restaurant which was not marked as being for valet service.  Nevertheless, as soon as we drove into that parking space the valet pounced.  If it were really a valet parking space, it should have been clearly marked as such.  With tip, almost $10.2.  The menu stated that salad was included in all New York steak orders.  When my steak arrived, there was no salad.  When called to the attention of the waiter he stated that he exchanged the salad for the french onion soup that my wife and I shared.  I thought that very nice in that the onion soup was $15.00.  When the bill came, however, it was not treated as an exchange.  They still charged $6.50 for the soup.  If they are going to do that, they should ask the customer in advance if that meets with their approval or whether they still wanted the salad.3.  We held off on ordering dessert until we finished the meal.  We then asked the waiter which dessert he felt was better--the apple tart tartin or the bread pudding.  He recommended the tart which we then ordered.  The waited then proceeded to bring us both desserts, each with a candle on it, which again was a very kind thing to do.  However, when the bill came, they comped one dessert and charged us $14.00 for the other.  It was clear that we only wanted one dessert.  If they were going to comp the dessert for our anniversary, that would be much appreciated.  But to serve a second dessert, which we did not order, and charge full price for it, was just not proper."
5,5,5,5,This is a wonderful place for celebration of a special occasion or just to have a great dinner at a classy restaurant. The food is outstanding. The service is outstanding. There鈥檚 nothing like a professional wait staff and Mistral has it.
5,5,5,5,Great restaurant! Consistently good. Personally.I love the John Dory ( a hard to find delicious fish).
1,1,4,2,Mediocre food. Very high prices.Never coming back.
5,5,5,5,Romantic place to have dinner
5,5,5,5,GREAT food. Amazing service. Beautiful old fashion restaurant. Very romantic. Highly recommended.
5,4,5,4,"My friend and I very much enjoyed dining at Mistral Sherman Oaks. The service was superb. The dishes we ordered were presented beautifully, however the taste wasn't as impressive. It was a bit noisy to have an intimate conversation but the restaurant was full with an good and energetic feel."
5,5,5,5,Friend鈥檚 Birthday
5,5,5,5,Lovely spot for a quiet lunch conversation.  Wonderful deco bar from the former restaurant.
5,5,5,5,"I love this place. We used to come here all the time when we were younger. Now, it鈥檚 for special occasions and I still LOVE it. Yes, it can get LOUD. Go early to avoid, or just go with it. It鈥檚 a warm atmosphere and great food. Just bring good friends!"
5,5,5,5,I love everything about the restaurant.  The staff is exceptional - from the valet parking attendant to the inside personnel.  The food is wonderful.
5,5,5,4,Always enjoyable but the noise level is deafening
5,5,5,5,Great food and service
5,5,5,5,Loved it!  Took a job candidate for dinner.  The food was amazing and the service was perfect.  Can't wait to go back!
5,5,5,5,always perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,5,5,5,A fantastic place for an excellent lunch with friends and family. Top notch NY strip steak in a pleasant relaxing ambience.
5,5,5,4,Absolutely fabulous
5,5,5,5,Our anniversary
5,5,4,5,Best tuna tartar anywhere. Fish always well prepared and very tasty
5,5,5,5,Best service. Food is delicious and always consistent.
5,5,5,5,Excellent food and service nice atmosphere a bit noisy! Overall excellent
5,5,5,5,Mistral has been around for over 25 years. Consistently good food. One of my favorites
5,5,4,4,"We very much enjoyed our meal at Mistral, which provides an old school French Bistro ambiance and formal service.  We ordered three of the appetizers that were featured the day of our visit and I highly encourage diners to follow suit.  The amuse was a lovely blue cheese cream puff, and the appetizers we enjoyed included the delicious peppers and jamon & date salad.  The featured halibut was a generous portion, on a lovely creamy corn and vegetable mixture.  One of our diners had the New York steak and frites, which were crisp and delicious.  And don't skip over the chocolate souffl茅 when the waiter asks you if you want to order one when you place your entr茅e orders.  There was one celebrity sighting when we were there, and lots of interesting people watching as well!"
5,5,5,5,"My husband said it was not just the best meal he had at Mistral, but the best meal ever.  He traveled all over the world on business and pleasure for over 30 years.  When I took him to my favorite restaurant in Paris, he said it was fine.  Obviously, he does not give praise lightly.  Mistral is always at the top of our list."
5,5,5,5,"I love this place! It鈥檚 perfect! Food, service, ambiance everything!"
4,4,4,3,"We met another couple at Mistral for lunch. Had to move from our original table, as the group they seated at a table nearby was literally inches away from us. Far too close for a comfortable dining experience.  But Mistral was happy to reseat us. Menu had lots of great options and daily specials. Food was good. I had the chopped salad and it was good size. They dropped off complimentary bread/cheese appetizer puffs which was nice. My husband had the baked salmon. Said it was slightly undercooked, but ok. He would not recommend the spinach as it was bitter. The Chardonnay was notably overpriced for the brand. The overall ambiance was good..think French bistro with white tablecloths and they did provide black napkins upon request.  They have valet parking and some metered street parking was available as well. Apparently, this place has been here over 30 years. The tab for the four of us, including tip, was about $200. I would likely go back, as I would like to further explore their menu, but I would use their corkage ((I think I recall it was $20) over their wine list."
5,5,5,5,"We鈥檝e been to Mistral many times and it always feels like a special occasion .From the warm welcome to the friendly and helpful staff, to the outstanding delicious food, it adds up to a perfect evening that feels like a celebration even if it鈥檚 a Tuesday"
5,5,5,5,"Foods and Services are great! All dining personnel, from the Hostess to the waiters, the clean up team and the valet parking man, were friendly, patient and accommodating. The other guests were also very pleasant. It's a beautiful restaurant. The tables and seating are very comfortable, is plenty of room, isn't crammed. The noise level is perfect. We didn't have to raise our voice and were able to hear each other very well."
2,3,3,2,"The food was okay, but not as good as the price suggests. The place was way too loud, so the experience of being there and eating with friends was meh. We couldn鈥檛 even hear each other!"
5,5,5,5,"Love the people, love the service and especially love the dood!"
5,5,5,5,"Food, service, and ambiance were outstanding, as usual."
5,5,5,5,We have been eating at Mistral for over 17 years and are always delighted.
5,5,5,4,"This is a wonderful restaurant that we frequent. French influenced food expertly prepared. The San Fernando valley is not noted for its culinary achievements, but this restaurant is at the top, and can successfully compete with leading Los Angeles restaurants"
4,4,4,4,"Lovely, relaxing, perfect night out!  Great service, wonderful bartender, outstanding food!  A gem in Sherman Oaks!"
5,5,5,5,Always a top notch experience.
5,5,5,5,The classic European feel to Mistral was the perfect setting for my Daughter's Family Birthday Celebration!  The food was delicious and the service was A+!!!
5,5,5,4,Best tuna tartar anywhere!. Fish all excellent. Blueberry tart scrumptious
5,5,5,5,"As always, our meal was wonderful."
5,5,5,5,"Dinner was fabulous. I can't wait to go back! Of note was our wonderful waitress. Thoughtful, knowledgeable and just lovely."
4,3,5,5,"The food was a bit too salty. However the presentation of the food, room ambience and service was excellent."
5,5,5,5,"Lovely menu, well-executed dishes.  Interesting wine list and excellent service."
5,5,5,5,One of the best Michelin starred restaurants in NYC with zero stuffiness. Incredible value. I am going as much as I can. Need I say more?
5,3,4,5,Great little hideaway bar with interesting history at Grand Central Terminal.
5,5,5,5,my favorite restaurant in NYC these days. go go go go
5,5,5,5,"We always love coming here. The atmosphere manages to be intimate and buzzy at the same time. The service/food/wine is impeccable. Since it is a no-tipping restaurant, the price point ends up being well below other restaurants that aren't even on its level. Definitely recommend!"
3,4,2,4,"While the food was very good, the service was NOT attentive (unless you were the wealthy couple sitting near us who had chefs come out from the kitchen to fawn on them).  We had to ASK our waiter for a refill of our water glasses and then nobody actually did it until we finally stopped a suit clad higher functionary who actually did the work himself.  Staff training is needed (as is an attitude adjustment)."
4,4,4,5,"While waitstaff is polite and knowledgeable, they were slow during a midday rush.  Perhaps too few people for the guest load."
5,5,5,5,The food and the service was outstanding!
4,4,4,4,"After so many years, the Modern has maintained its high standard with food, service and ambience! Its a reliable place to go back to!"
5,5,5,5,"The atmosphere, the service, and the food make this our favorite place to eat in New York."
5,5,5,5,"Great casual place. The food is creative and delicious, the service was great.I highly recommend it."
5,5,5,4,I have dined at the Modern Bar room dozens of time-never had a bad meal-you can't go wrong if you decide to eat there and it is also very popular for just drinks.
5,5,5,5,Great food
5,5,5,5,"Everything was great. The setting, the food and the wait staff. We had a lovely evening. Will definitely visit again"
5,5,5,5,Great as always!!
5,5,5,5,"With the MOMA renovations causing closure of the art museum temporarily, we had to skip our annual visit. However, the Bar at the Modern was available so we were able to enjoy a marvellous Saturday lunch.  Service was skilled and our waiter was very well informed on the options and preparation details. Every course of our three course meal was amazing in taste and presentation."
1,1,2,2,"I cannot believe the huge disappointment I experienced at The Bar at the Modern, which has been one of my favorite spots in NYC since it opened...we even celebrated there the day of the birth of our first grandson eleven and a half years ago...and I always want friends visiting us in NYC to meet us at The Bar at the Modern.I brought a friend who had never been to the restaurant for lunch, specifically to try the tart d'alsace.This was a new food for her...when this rectangle that looked like a slice of pizza arrived I was shocked.That is not a tart d'alsace,  I thot...it had a lot of red and green in it...not the creamy white I was accustomed to...and the taste was unidentifiable...my friend said all she could taste was salt.  I did not complain...at least I thot the tart was edible, but could not explain the taste.My baby gem lettuce salad was ok,  but not as lovely as I expiated, to the eye and the tongue.My friend was aghast that the soup of the day cost 24 dollars, but she ordered it as she was not very hungry (we lunched early...ll:45 )...I was so devastated that I considered, and still am ,  writing directly to Danny Meyer.  He would be horrified had he been at our table yesterday Aug 30. I will not be returning to The Modern, unless an explanation is given.  I can get a beautiful tart d'alsace at BENOIT, as I did on Aug l9...the size of the tart was generous and share - able with 5 other people at my table for drinks and small plates...the size of the MODERN's tart was not even enough for two.Ah well..in the big picture of life I can handle such a disappointment.  But this indeed feels like a loss of one of my favorite places in NYC.Patricia Lahrmer Ross on Aug 3l 20l9"
5,5,5,5,"Great service, fantastic food, highly recommend"
5,5,5,5,Great dinner!
5,5,5,5,The overall experience was top notch.  This proved to be a perfect choice for the night.
5,5,5,5,The food and service at the Modern Bar Room were excellent.  I was also struck by the quality and presentation temperature of the wines by the glass.  Many restaurants in nyc serve very poor wines by the glass kept at the wrong temperature.  This was not at all the case at the Modern - the wine was excellent.
5,5,4,5,The food is so high quality and the tastes explode in the dish. The crispy salmon was tremendous.
5,5,5,4,"We had an amazing meal here, and it really made me want to experience the main dining room someday. My spouse and I each ordered the three course tasting menu, choosing an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I had the wine pairings as well, while he ordered a Manhattan.  Every single thing I ate was perfect. My very favorite was the charred avocado with peekytoe crab. The flavors and textures of that dish will stay with me for a long time to come. I cannot recommend it highly enough. My spouse started with the corn soup, which I had almost ordered. It was very tasty, but nowhere near as good as the avocado. The service was very attentive, with our water frequently refilled and being checked in with regularly. The time between courses might have felt long if you were in a hurry or very hungry, but for us it was the perfect pacing. The room definitely has a lively atmosphere, which is nice, though the tables are quite close and it was hard to tune out the conversation at the table next to us."
5,5,5,5,The bartenders were very attentive and demonstrated great mixology Skills as well as menu knowledge.
5,5,5,4,"Caesar was just an amazing service provider - his suggestions were spot on and so was the service provided by every other member  at this restaurant, thank you for making a huge difference in the way you treat your guests."
4,5,5,1,Food was terrific.  Staff was very accommodating.  However the room smelled of fresh paint.  That is very unappetizing.  Perhaps the restaurant should close on days when it is freshly painted.
5,5,4,5,As always a most pleasurable dining experience. The wine list is extraordinary as are the prices with only a handful below triple digits.
5,5,5,5,Fabulous restaurant week menu ...we both had the salmon that was cooked to perfection. Service was excellent...waiter/waitresses friendly and professional..
4,4,4,4,"The ambiance, door and service were spot on. The 鈥榓nnouncement鈥 of each dish was over the top and unnecessary, particularly when some of the dishes were repetitive from one diner to the next. It seemed silly and disingenuous. $18 for a glass of white wine had us passing on spirits at lunch. It would have been nice for the iced tea drinker and the coffee drinkers to be offered seconds for the price of $7.00 for an iced tea and $6.00 for a cup of Joe. It鈥檚 the little things..."
5,5,5,5,"Perfection!  Fabulous food, great service, lovely ambience.  Can't wait to go back :)"
5,5,5,5,"Was visiting this place twice during a restaurant week.  Amazing a nd delicious food, great service!!! Thank you!!!!"
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic! Wait staff excellent. Picked two course restaurant menu for lunch. Amazing salmon and cavatelli dishes. Cocktails sublime. Also, the modern is a no tip establishment but you wod never know it, the service was impeccable.  Only negative was we had planned on going next door to MOMA but its closed until mid October."
5,5,5,5,We really like and enjoyed the service and the food! We go to upscale restaurants sometimes. This one is at the top of the list of the restaurants we went in terms of the food taste. Highly recommend.
5,5,5,5,Service was very nice and sweet. Food is of great quality and value. Went there for the restaurant week but will certainly go back again.
5,5,5,4,This was a terrific evening made all the better by the attentiveness of Maitre d' Michele Molier.  I had managed to put our reservation on the calendar for the incorrect date.  We showed  up a day early and could not have returned on the next night.  Michele  led us to the bar and then went to work finding us an  table.  Shortly we were escorted to an ideal table for memorable dinner.
1,1,1,4,Disappointing from start to finish. We have come to value the Modern on our 鈥淎鈥 List of fine cuisine. We selected the Restaurant Week offerings. Servers lacked adequate knowledge of the vintages. 鈥淪hort鈥 pours dominated. The Main course was bland and tasteless. Two slices of bread were an additional charge. Rather insulting. Wine pairings were delayed with food arrival. The meal was rushed although there was ample seating. Our servers were not attentive. The only redeeming part was the support table staff. The Modern has been always exceptional. Unfortunately this experience falls into the ONE STAR category ... at best.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful time. Everything is perfect from start to finish.
5,5,5,5,Exquisite!
5,5,5,5,Everything about this meal was spectacular!
5,5,5,5,Did was wonderful. Chef and staff were amazing. Sourdough was mind blowing. Would steal sourdough starter if I could.
4,4,3,5,"Inventive & creative food, which was all enjoyable, but a little slow on keeping my wine glass full throughout meal."
2,2,4,4,The food was delicious until you realized there was a hair in your caviar dish and also a fly just landed on a bowl of rice they prepared in front of you.
5,5,5,5,Extraordinario!! Mejor que uno o dos restaurantes de tres estrellas que hemos visitado en la ciudad. El maridaje excelente!! No se lo pierdan.
5,4,5,4,"Spectacular place, great food perfect pairings..."
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food and wine pairings, you can never go wrong!"
5,5,5,5,Most wonderful experience! One of our favorite places to come to and not just because of the food. The team is practically like family now and the food is always so amazing! We can鈥檛 wait to come back!
5,5,5,5,"Coming from the UK I was perhaps expecting a more overtly Asian experience with David Chang鈥檚 pedigree but from the moment we were welcomed in from the torrential rain it was an outstanding experience. The staff were exemplary at all levels- professional but friendly and so helpful. The 13 course meal was beautifully paced, the dishes clearly explained with a multitude  of tastes of Asian influences into a classic cuisine. The seating on 3 sides of the kitchen was comfortable and felt like a large dinner party. I have to mention  the best  sea urchin dish, lobster paloise, the pork and the foie gras dessert which was heaven.I will go back next time in NY."
5,5,5,5,EXCELLENT!! It was an experience like no other! The food was amazing and edgy and the drink pairings were the best I鈥檝e ever had. The service was the best I鈥檝e ever had and would definitely reccomend it to any foodie enthusiast.
5,5,5,5,Amazing like always
5,5,5,5,"Not like any other Michelin 2 Star restaurant we have ever tried...fun, innovative, and very un-French! The food and service were definitely beyond excellent, though. The food just kept getting more unique as the evening progressed: everything was super-fresh, and the flavor combinations were just incredible. The space was intimate, but we never felt crowded. It was really unique to watch each dish being prepared. We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the experience."
5,5,5,5,"We had had a terrible day thanks to flight delays, plane trouble, runway construction, and the mess that is LaGuardia. We left the airport right when our reservation should have been seating. Having called ahead and talk with the staff about what was going on and hoping they could hold our reservation, we made a mad dash for the restaurant. We walked in with suitcases, 45 mins after our scheduled time, and were treated like family. It was wonderful to taken care of so well, even when we had inconvenienced the staff. They turned a terrible day into a purely enjoyable evening. Thank you to the staff that made us feel at ease, gave us an enjoyable meal, and were nothing but professional hospitality masters."
5,5,5,5,Amazing. Cozy and fun
5,5,5,5,"Third visit here and enjoyed every course on the menu. Saw some classics from prior visits, but also got quite a few new dishes that were absolutely wonderful. Dungeness crab doughnut and 30 day aged strip loin were delicious. Bravo!"
5,5,5,5,One of the best culinary experiences I have ever had!
5,5,5,5,"Magical, memorable dining experience. The staff are super friendly and really enhance the meal. The dining room is beautiful, unique and very comfortable; love being in the heart of the action at the counter and watching the chefs preparing your food. The food is extremely creative, top quality ingredients, interesting, perfectly executed and most of all delicious - from the opening bites through dessert. Fantastic wine program; tried some amazing wines with the pairing. Highly recommend Ko!"
3,3,5,5,"I would recommend Ko to super rich friends who like great music.  We went as a special birthday weekend of eating at David Chang鈥檚 restaurants and we thought Noodle Bar far superior in terms and flavor and value.  The service at Ko was impeccable, almost spooky in its prescience and timing.  The food was certainly beautiful and interesting but just not so delicious that the $510 price tag was worth it.  Two of the 12-13 dishes were outstanding 鈥 the Danish yellowtail and the egg. The others were just a little too salty.  The three courses with fried elements 鈥 the lobster roll, the chive potato pillow things, and the crab donut had good flavor but they were all cold.  All of them.  We saw the next diners鈥 donuts sitting for 12 minutes after leaving the fryer.We love funky flavors, but every single course had something funky 鈥 too relentless, especially combined with the aggressive salt. We wanted to be wowed, especially since my husband loves DC: listens to his podcast, reads about him, and follows him on social media.  We will be back to the Noodle Bar but we regret the splurge at Ko."
5,5,5,5,Eating here met every bit of hype that comes with it. The food was life-changingly good and the staff made you feel like family.
5,5,5,5,"Fabulous food. Great service. I wouldn鈥檛 go with the wine pairing again, though. It was too much. Even though the pours are small, there are a LOT of them."
5,5,5,5,"Simply one of the best meals I've had in my life. Service, food, everything."
5,5,5,5,"The evening here was a revelation - regarding the amazing food, the personal and relaxed service and the innovative drink menu accompanying the food."
5,5,5,5,Our second visit here and just as amazing as our first. The menu was mostly different items but equally delicious. Service is outstanding. Music was too loud but I'm old and old people think all music is too loud. Lol
5,5,5,5,"Perfect food, and gracious informative service. An outstanding evening. Plus, the best bottle of Sake I have ever had and I'm 71!! So I have had a few bottles of Sake in my time."
5,5,5,5,"Great experience from start to finish. I loved the beverage pairings -- nice variety of red, white, sparkling, beer and sake. Service was outstanding and the fact that service is included was a pleasant surprise (I see now it's noted on the website, but I had not noticed.) I was dining solo and the counter is a fantastic place to watch all the kitchen action with never a boring moment."
5,4,5,5,Food was beautifully presented and yummy. The place is kind of hard to find if u take taxi because they don鈥檛 know where 鈥渆xtra pl鈥 is. Love the ambience and decor and service was excellent. Would definitely go again !
5,5,5,5,What a cool experience! Food was amazing. The place was amazing. The staff was amazing!
5,5,5,5,The food is innovative and delicious. I鈥檝e done my fair share of tasting menus and left hungry but not here! Also the wine pairing is excellent - very thoughtful and really brings out flavor in both the food and wine. I鈥檇 come back here again when I am in NYC!
5,5,5,5,Fabulous! Maybe the best experience in NYC now.
4,5,2,4,"Excellent food. Service is not great. For the price you pay, you should not have to grab someone鈥檚 attention for drinks menu.And for the price you pay, when a dish is supposed to come with a basket of bread, you shouldn鈥檛 have to remind someone that they forgot to give it to you."
5,5,5,5,Once in a lifetime extravaganza! Incredible!  Now we're hooked on white sturgeon cavier!
5,5,5,5,"The setting was great - only a small number of people sitting at a bar around the preparation area. The food was eclectic but delicious. The atmosphere was more casual than most other starred restaurants, but staff were friendly and knowledgeable."
5,5,5,5,Incredible experience.
5,5,5,5,It is a culinary experience.  I would highly recommend a dinner.    The service and food were top shelf. Try it you will love it.
5,5,5,5,Amazing experience!
5,5,5,5,"Incredible, personalized service, creative food, and impressive wine pairings."
5,5,5,5,Fantastic! Great food from start to finish! Wish I was able to take a slice of that peach pie home with me
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely awesome food! The tastes are so straight forward, and honest, and pure! The wine (which we ordered by the bottle) was so lovely and fitted perfectly with the dishes! The staff is absolutely jovial, open and helpful! The vibe is just awesome!We'll be back!"
5,5,5,5,In NYC?  You must go... period.  Amazing experience and food to die for.  Perfect execution and staff.
5,5,5,5,"Unbelievable decor, service and food.  I would highly recommend you spend a few extra bucks to experience this....experience."
5,5,5,4,Everything was wonderful as always!
5,5,5,5,We love it. NHS is one of our go to places! Thanks
5,5,3,5,"We love neighborhood services, and always have a great experience. Our server this time around was just not very friendly and seemed overly rushed to get us served and out of the table. We know it was a busy night, but we normally don鈥檛 get that from the servers here. Overall it was great per usual!"
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, cannot wait to visit my daughter again so we can go back."
5,5,5,5,always a great experience. The originals one delivers great food and service.
5,5,5,5,"My most recent visit was on a Monday.  Eric provided wonderful service, the Manager, Julia checked in to make sure all was well also.  We enjoyed Oysters, Halibut, perfectly cooked salmon and a great Jordan Cabernet.  All good, per usual!"
3,5,2,3,"Neighbor Services is generally a very loud restaurant, but if you get wrong table, by the bar, it can be a very bad experience.  I have had several substantial delays or poor seating experiences recently.  While the food is excellent, it is difficult to get past the fact that you cannot hear conversations because of the noise and well as the difficulties with timely seating."
5,5,5,5,Great place with consistently delicious food prepared to perfection.  Love this restaurant.  It never disappoints!
5,5,5,5,One of the top 5 places in Dallas.  Consistently good.
5,5,5,5,Always  A+
5,5,5,2,Absolutely amazing food and drinks! Only complaint is that it is super LOUD!
5,5,5,5,Yeahhhhhhh i
2,2,5,4,"We were looking forward to this place as we'd heard good things about it.  Honestly, the service was great, but the food was just average.  We found it to be overpriced and over rated."
5,5,5,4,Our server was awesome. The fish was good. It is still a very loud restaurant! But the food is always good!
5,5,5,5,Outstanding as always!
5,5,5,5,Always delicious
5,5,5,5,"Neighborhood Service is fast becoming one of our favorite places to eat in our area! The food, drinks and service are always top notch and we just love coming to this wonderful restaurant!"
5,5,5,5,We just moved to Dallas and are trying to find our "go to" places to eat.  We loved the energy here!  Our waiter was fantastic and so was the food.  We'll definitely be back.
5,5,5,5,Great meal and service as always!
5,5,5,5,Everything was terrific AND we went on a weeknight so not too LOUD..
2,3,2,3,"Arrived on a Saturday night at 8:25pm for a 8:30pm reservation and was finally seated at 9:02pm.  No seating in the bar space as they clearly over-reserve so stood the entire time.  Asked if this was unusual and the hostess said no, it wasn't, that it was normal to wait 25 minutes or so past the reservation time.  Not sure if over-reserving is the best business strategy.  Food was OK, service was fine, but would not go back due to the inefficient house management."
5,5,5,5,Justin was fantastic!
2,4,4,5,"Had another bad experience with having to wait over 30 minutes with a reservation. Wonderful restaurant and the manager was apologetic, but they have a problem overbooking and are repeat offenders with this annoying habit. Last time we waited over an hour for with a reservation"
5,5,5,4,Love everyone that works there and the food is delicious and consistent
5,5,5,4,"Jennifer was terrific as our server.  Patient, flexible, engaging and readily able to suggest gluten free modifications.  Our family has a wide variety of food preferences and restrictions and all were happy; all rates their food well; all would come back.  I鈥檇 highly recommend it!"
5,5,5,5,Excellent food and service.
5,5,5,5,It鈥檚 always a wonderful experience! Great food great people!
5,5,5,5,"This truly is one of the best restaurants in town. I love the menu; the asparagus appetizer is always a must and in spite of all the tempting choices, the schnitzel is hard to not be the choice."
5,5,5,5,Excellent food as always
5,5,5,5,"Each time we come to Dallas we visit Neighborhood Services. Each time we expect that it can鈥檛 possibly live up to our last visit with outstanding service, delicious and super creative-without-being-strange food, plus great cocktails. But it DID live up to our expectations. AGAIN. Can鈥檛 wait to come back."
5,5,5,5,"Excellent contemporary fair that spends from high end seafood to old fashioned fixins. A great place to see those in the know about food and fare from most walks, the most common thread being those who can appreciate a fine meal, beverage, and conversation."
4,5,5,4,Always a go-to place.  A little something for everyone done with creative flair.  Too bad it's so noisy you can't have a conversation with your dining partners.
4,4,4,4,"I love Neighborhood Services this time some of the food was a little salty. The halibut and wedge salad was perfect, but the stroganoff had too much salt in the sauce. The meat was tender and the pasta was good.  Service is always great!"
3,5,4,4,We were disappointed that we had an 8:30 reservation and were not seated till 9:15. The hostess was very apologetic. Our server was friendly and brought us an appetizer 鈥渙n the house鈥 to help ease the frustration of waiting so long!
5,5,5,4,"This place was great, service was excellent, food was equally great, was pretty loud but we went to visit with friends so that was not an issue!"
5,5,5,5,It鈥檚 the best-ALWAYS!!!
2,3,3,2,"We had a reservation, however, after waited about 20 minutes we were still being told the same thing - that people were paying their bills and it would be just a minute. As it was 8:30pm at this time, we decided to sit at the bar. The restaurant is VERY loud and it wasn't just because we were in the bar area. It is a relatively small place so it wouldn't have mattered where we were. The food was pretty good, but I would be hesitant to go back since they can't handle their reservations. The place was packed - too crowded for my taste. They need to figure out a way to handle the intake and still make it conducive to having a conversation. The best note was the bartender, Rob, who took care of us. He was very pleasant and attentive."
5,5,5,5,The best.  I just have a hard time deciding on my enter. The wedge salad is to die for
5,5,5,5,Great evening once again at NHS!!  Waitress was very attentive.  Food was excellent!!!
4,4,4,4,Very good!
4,5,3,3,"FIT FOR A FOODIEOrchids at Palm Court is a restaurant fit for foodies. The food, the main focus, is exquisite. I didn't think a dish could be better than the blue cheese salad I had as my first course. The rabbit trio proved me wrong.  What an excellent dish.The wine list is very expensive, but there are a few good deals to be found."
5,4,5,5,Beautiful place! Love the classic style. The service was outstanding! Best in Cincinnati! Perfect for a special occasion. They really made the dinner a success for our family celebration.
5,5,5,5,"Always one of the best meals you can have in Cincinnati.  Service was fantastic, food is decadent and the place really had an energy...  It was very busy in the bar, busy in the lobby, you could hear the piano playing in the background.....  Just a fun, relaxing experience."
5,5,5,5,Had an amazing time. Our server tate was incredibly knowledgeable about the dishes and the service he provided was wonderful. Truly made our anniversary special.
5,5,5,5,"As indicated the ambiance was great. Very high class. Perfect for our 51st wedding anniversary celebration. We were also so pleased with the attitude and assistance of the wait staff as they prepared and served our meal with consideration for our necessity to leave rather soon. Our fault, not theirs, as traffic and our timing was wanting. Nevertheless we arrived at Music Hall in time for a wonderful concert. A fine evening of celebrating. Thank you."
5,4,5,5,"Our first experience at Orchids was amazing. I loved the ambience, and the service was perfect. Tate took great care of us. Food was well executed - not my favorite tartare, but the second course maitake was amazing. We were also sent off with a cute little granola bar covered in their in house honey - so good! Great dinner - perfect for a special occasion."
5,5,5,5,"This was our first time at Orchids and it met our expectations and more. The food was excellent, the service superb and the ambiance just right. My wife and totally enjoined a special evening at Orchids at the Palm Court."
5,5,5,5,Awesome experience and consistent every time!
5,5,5,5,"Celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary on Saturday evening. We had the tasting menu and everything was exquisite.  I've written reviews for Orchids before and everything I said then, is the same today.Our service was impeccable - amazing team, amazing food and amazing atmosphere.  Thank you ALL for a very special anniversary dinner."
5,5,5,5,Amazing staff and the ambiance is beyond compare. The menu is top notch! We had a fantastic evening celebrating our sons 30th birthday.
5,5,5,5,Everything was outstanding as usual.  We brought friends to celebrate their anniversary.  They were truly impressed.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing experience, worthy of a special occasion.  The staff is very knowledgeable and polite.  The menu has a nice variety, and each dish is delicious."
5,5,5,5,"We had a great dinner and the atmosphere were was enjoyable.The mood was wonderful with live music, will go again."
5,5,5,5,"We were warmly greeted and allowed time for a quick drink before dinner. Our waiter Tate explained each item with enthusiasm  so that I wanted to try everything.  His descriptions were spot on and his recommendations were terrific.  Service was prompt and efficient. The wine list is extensive and offers good selections in all price ranges. The wait time between ordering dessert and being served was a little longer than ideal...not a complaint, just an observation.  I recommend Orchids any and all occasions."
5,5,5,5,Great experience.  Classic Art Deco ambiance.  Service outstanding.  Corn chowder appetizer special.  Chef creations between courses elegant.  Avocado ice cream with coconut cake dessert great as well.  Would definitely go back.
5,5,5,5,Everything about the entire dining experience was perfect.
5,5,5,5,Wonderful meal.   Maitre D and server were beyond great!
5,5,5,3,The star of the experience was the food.and the chef and servers were devoted to this end.  The delicious combinations of foods and their surprising variety Constantly kept our attention.  So glad we weren鈥檛 in company so we would have to make conversation.  And proportions seemed just right so that at the end of the meal we were just comfortable and satisfied.
5,4,5,5,"Wonderful! The staff, the drinks and food, and overall experience are fabulous. It was a special anniversary celebration!"
4,4,4,4,"The ambiance at Palm Court is wonderful!  It is definitely a special occasion restaurant because of the prices, but quite a dining experience!  I loved it!"
1,1,3,5,"I've had in the last few years at Orchides at Palm Court some of the best meals that I've enjoyed that I have ever had in my culinary travels here and abroad.  So my meal this past Tuesday evening was extremely disappointing, to say the least, particularly as I had taken a guest there to show that person that we did have a dining experience in Cincinnati that could match he marvelous meal he had just had in New York City.  The two rolls and the bread stick were without question exceptional!  A+ The amuse bouche was ""texturally"" quite stimulating but nothing ""amusingly""  tasty.  The corn soup first course was rich and smooth, but overpoweringly corn flavored.  The entree, halibut, was a culinary disaster:  it looked like a wounded war causality, served in a dark, blackened banana peel that the server suggested I not try eating, topped with a gray-green sauce on an over-cooked and dry piece of fish.  I sent it back.  I order the scallops with cauliflower bites; it too was not an attractive presentation nor a particularly interesting or satisfying tasting entree.  And the dessert, highly recommended by the server, a spice cake was overpoweringly sweet, a sugar fix, but rather an attractive work of art.  The wine was satisfactory, but not compelling."
5,4,5,5,The atmosphere and service are outstanding. The food was very good but not incredible.
5,5,5,5,Anniversary!! Great time!
5,5,5,5,Wonderful evening!!  Beautiful venue!  The tasting menu was exquisite and the service five star!!
5,5,5,5,We had a pregnancy announcement for my parents and got very special treatment from all of the staff.  They are all very genuine and care about this restaurant and their jobs.  Everyone is very attentive.  Perfect ambiance as well.
3,1,4,5,"We have always liked Orchids for special occasions because of traditional menu expectations.  That is no longer the case and I doubt if we will be back.  Quite frankly, the menu was just plain weird.  Maybe it was our choices, but the flavorings were much to Eastern Mediterranean for our tastes.  The lamb was tough, and the lamb sausages were hard and just plain awful.  Having suffered this meal and its ridiculous cost, explains why there was virtually no other diners and it was just 7:00pm"
5,5,5,5,This of course is a high end restaurant as it is in a wonderful old hotel. The food was some of the best I have had. The dishes had several layers of taste and texture all complimenting each other. The service was spot on with dishes being presented at the same time to me and my guest (nice touch not seen very often anymore). I like to dine up and The Orchids did not disappoint.
5,5,5,5,Total dining experience. Fabulous from start to finish. A must if you're visiting and have never been before.
5,5,5,5,This was our first time. At first I was disappointed that they didnt have filet mignon but their ny strip steak was amazing.
5,5,5,5,Very good!  We had a lovely birthday dinner.  It was great.
5,4,5,5,"This is always a special place.  Service is second to none (special thanks to Samantha for making the evening wonderful).  Meals are decadent and well-presented (although this trip we found the cook on the duck a little over....still good).  Put this on your list for a special occasion, or when you need to buy yourself out of a screwup with your partner."
5,5,5,5,"As always a great dining experience. The food was on point with a few pleasant surprises. Joel was patient with us as we chose a wine and the service, as always, was great."
5,5,5,5,Excellent!
5,5,5,5,"New menu items were delightful. Smoked salmon, corn soup, foie gras, strip with prawn and rabbit trio were all excellent."
5,5,5,5,"Fabulous cocktails, spectacular meal, excellent staff, great wine pairings... overall a wonderful evening."
5,5,5,4,"Overall the ambiance is great, but the live music in the adjacent bar could be turned down a bit.  Service is outstanding as is the food.  The menu is somewhat eclectic, but not too far out there.  Palm Court has an outstanding selection of cocktails, served perfectly.  The extra touches add a lot to the experience and the entire staff is on their game.   We will be back at the first opportunity."
5,5,5,5,everything you want from a high-end romantic evening out.
5,5,5,5,"Great experience. This was a special event for us, and going somewhere this 鈥渇ancy鈥 was almost intimidating. But, the staff made us feel very comfortable and there was the freedom to pick and choose which courses we ordered from.  Great food, outstanding presentation, and definitely made our night special."
5,4,5,5,A very special place for celebrating special occasions.
5,5,5,5,Everything was exceptional; I don't think I can recommend a better top to bottom experience than this one.
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely the best, this restaurant is a gem, very creative and delicious food, I really think the chef is a genius.It is expensive so it is best for special occasions."
5,5,5,4,I was a little frustrated that they allow use of cell phones (voice) in the dining room.    Table next to us took no less than 4 calls.
5,5,5,5,"Oriole is one of the finest dining experiences I have had. The overall ambience, service, and menu were all up to a 5-star caliber. I have eaten at a couple of different multi-course, prix fixe menu restaurants, and this one reigns supreme over the others. It definitely earns its two Michelin stars鈥攚ith a pairing of flavors and culinary surprises you may not expect to cohesively deliver a tasteful dish. I don鈥檛 want to spoil their current menu too much for those wanting to go in blind; so, I will just state I liked every single dish they brought forward. Aside from the food, they also gave my partner and I a signed card and additional favors to make our anniversary particularly special. They seemed to really care how the diners felt about their restaurant and that type of thing definitely should not go unnoticed. I can鈥檛 wait until my next trip to Chicago as I have already booked a table well in advance for my return!"
5,5,5,5,"Unbelieveable. The experience, the food, the service, the ambience. Michelin has it wrong giving this place 2 stars. It should be 3. All of the food was hot. Drinks were extremely well balanced. Just unreal"
5,5,5,5,Mom visiting from Korea
5,5,5,5,"Our evening at Oriole was very special and one that we will remember and cherish for years to come. Our server, Eryka was amazing, friendly, very knowledgeable, and absolutely darling. The staff worked seamlessly together, and we felt at home from the moment we walked in. It鈥檚 hard for us to pick just one favorite dish, as they were all incredible, but the mushroom really blew us away. They were also very accommodating to my allergies! The staff at Oriole made Jeff鈥檚 birthday very special and we are very grateful for everyone that was a part of it. We look forward to returning!"
5,5,5,5,One of the best dining experiences and the best choice for my sister's birthday. The food was delicious and they accommodated our dietary needs. The service was impeccable and they made it a special evening all around. It was a beautiful space that was comfortable with a Chicago feel.
5,5,5,5,Totally recommended. My husband and I celebrated our first anniversary here and the staff made us feel so special from beginning to end. Every single course was delicious and the wine pairing absolutely worth it. Amazing and unforgettable experience.
5,5,5,5,4th time. just keeps getting better & better. maybe the best restaurant in the US currently.
5,5,5,5,"We were excited to dine at Oriole for our 38th anniversary. Our dinner more than lived up to our expectations. Each course was beautifully presented, very well explained, and most importantly delicious to eat. The standard wine pairing was tasty, presented a broad range of wines (including sake and pear cider), and informative descriptions from either wait staff or the sommelier. As to the staff, they were extremely attentive, yet unobtrusive and there was absolutely no sense that we were being rushed (in fact, at the conclusion of our evening I was surprised to see that 2 1/2 hours had passed). A final delightful touch was the goody bag, including chocolate chip cookies (including a recipe sheet), a printed menu that included our names and anniversary wishes, and a detailed menu of the wine pairing selections."
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and experience. Easily the best in Chicago
2,2,5,4,"Overall an abundance of effort put into the food. Considering the 2.5 hour long meal, it is an experience rather than just a meal. However, the food was saltier than I would prefer."
5,5,5,5,It鈥檚 was all so beautiful.
5,5,5,5,The food is divine. It is a true dining 鈥渆xperience鈥.
5,5,5,5,Wow!!! Amazing experience- all around
5,4,5,5,"Perhaps the best table service I've ever had. Like a well choreographed dance every step was perfect. While the dishes were very good, I didn't find them to be so delicious that I swooned over them and frankly, at this level I want to swoon!  May be just my personal taste but my dining partner felt pretty much the same way.  For perspective, I've dined at many fine restaurants over the years including Paul Bocuse Restaurant,  Alinea and the French Laundry."
5,5,5,5,Wow! Amazing! I can鈥檛 wait for the menu to change to visit again. The staff is incredible.....& the culinary experience is 5 猸愶笍猸愶笍猸愶笍猸愶笍猸愶笍. Treat yourself to the premium beverage experience & you won鈥檛 be disappointed. My only comment is that they should ask guests to refrain from wearing perfume or cologne....as it interferes with other guests experience.
5,5,5,5,Best meal I've had in the US
5,5,5,5,"Fabulous experience, the ambience, service was impeccable and every detail thought through. The food was exceptional, with every dish providing an incredible taste, texture and flavour. Would highly recommended."
5,5,5,5,Amazing food. Flavors and textures I鈥檝e never experienced before. We shared the standard wine pairing which was plenty and definitely added to the overall dining experience. A full one would have been too much. Service was professional and courteous. The most expensive meal I鈥檝e ever had. It鈥檚 was terrific but $650 for dinner for two and a split pairing (before) tip was a kick in the pants.
5,5,5,5,incredible in every way!
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food and service. Very nice.  Romantic, business, does not matter. Very good."
5,5,5,5,Beyond this incredible! Hands down better than Aliena.
5,5,5,5,Greatest dinner ever an experience of a lifetime
5,5,5,5,Favorite restaurant on Earth!
5,5,5,5,"Phenomenal , One of the best meals I鈥檝e ever had."
5,5,5,5,"An incredible experience. The sommelier was brilliant. The food was extraordinarily. The entry is unique and exciting, an experience unto itself. They treated us beautifully for our anniversary."
5,5,5,5,Easily one of the best three meals I've ever had.  Only one of a few restaurants where EVERY course in the tasting menu was superlative.
5,5,5,5,"One of the top restaurants in the city.  Ate there a year ago, and while the ingredients were similar, it was completely new presentations of their classic dishes.  That shows skill and creativity.  The staff is the kindest and most intelligent in the city.  Everyone who eats at Oriole recognizes it as the top."
3,5,1,4,"My cab was 10 minutes late and she called me from Oriole wondering why. She told me they needed my table later that night and since I was ten minutes behind that I had better 鈥渒eep up with the kitchen 鈥. When google maps got us there we could not find the entrance. I was delayed ten more minutes looking for the entrance.  Beware, you must 鈥渒eep up with the kitchen 鈥  and don鈥檛 let traffic delay you from servicing the diners coming after you!"
5,5,5,5,"Very elegant restaurant. Service was very good. Would have liked it better if all the servers explained about the dishes in a way that I could hear about them better. Some did a very fine job, while others were kind of whispering maybe because they are trying not to disrupt the ambience of the place. The dishes were unique, thoughtful, and very delicious. Specially enjoyed the sablefish course, as well as the rind and uni dish. The wagyu beef was phenomenal. The amount of dishes were just enough for the 2 1/2 hours experience. The cookie and the cookie recipe that were given as to go gifts were a nice touch."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely amazing!  Can鈥檛 wait to go back. The food was sublime. The pairing was perfect. Service was excellent.
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, fantastic service. I would imagine it takes tremendous talent and dedication to create this experience.  Try the reserve wine pairing, it just might be the best wine pairing in the world!"
5,5,5,5,"Had a great experience, service is one of a kind, and the food was amazing!!"
5,5,5,5,"After 35 years of special occasions at restaurants, this is in the top two and perhaps number one all time.  Incredibly creative and delicious items, paired perfectly with wine, sake and other libations, with servers who are friendly and fastidious without pretension.  An amazing experience."
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, experience    Would definitely come back again"
5,5,5,5,Great great great great
5,5,5,5,"An unforgettable experience, in all the best ways. The service is the best I鈥檝e ever had at any restaurant and the food was equally outstanding. I would highly recommend this experience."
5,5,5,5,Best meal of my life! Everything mas perfect and delicious!
5,5,5,5,"Food was delicious and original, service is the best I鈥檝e seen in the city."
5,5,5,5,Consistently good food in a warm and inviting setting.  Attentive wait staff but prices a little on the expensive side.
5,5,5,5,"We had a wonderful well prepared dinner on Sunday 11/10/19. The room was active, but not loud.The server was attentive ,but not pushy.Enjoyable!"
5,5,5,5,The best dinner as always.  It never disappoints.  It's also one of the few restaurants that actually made note of the fact that I said it was a birthday celebration when I made the reservation.
5,5,5,5,"Parc is my favorite restaurant.  Even when full the service is fantastic and personal.  The food is delicious, especially the dessert profiteroles!A magical place!"
5,5,4,5,Cocktails were great. Food was great we had breakfast. Everything coming out looked appealing. There was one hostess with very short hair that made the experience a little less than five stars with some attitude but everyone else was very accommodating and went out of their way. The decor was cute and the lighting was adorable. If it鈥檚 nice outside or you can brave the cold the outdoor dining is romantic and adorable. Would go back 100% if in town again!!
5,5,5,5,"You'll think you're in Paris.  Great food, wine, service, ambiance and location.  Looking forward to returning."
4,4,4,5,"The food was great. Ambiance was great. But we were rushed. They twice cleared plates before everyone was done. We were not dining slowly, but at an average pace and it was disappointing to have to request a plate to be put back down because we were not done."
5,5,5,5,Everything was perfect and delicious!!!Staff went above and beyond.
5,5,5,5,Great food for a Saturday brunch!  Enjoyed the cocktails and the beet salad with added chicken was delicious.
5,5,5,5,Great food
5,5,5,5,"Great time at Parc last night. Food was fantastic and the service both at the bar and our table was excellent. Lots of food options and great drink/wine selections as well. Busy place at 9pm on a Friday, so if your looking for action and a great meal, this is the spot."
5,5,5,5,Angel was the best server!!!
3,3,5,3,Seated next to a drafty door.  Steak was under cooked.  Very noisy dining experience.
5,5,5,5,"The food was amazing, I had the Pork Melanaise (the Thursday special) my wife had the Beef Bourguignon. Make sure you leave room for dessert delicious chocolate dish. The service is fantastic we had David as a waiter and the hostesses also took care of us at the table bringing drinks and helping box our leftovers.  the bartenders make the drinks perfectly."
5,5,5,5,Parc is perfect.
5,5,5,5,There is a reason Parc is at the top of every list of Philadelphia's best restaurants. Everything we had was top-notch. The cocktails yummy and flavors balanced. The food was simply perfect and well-proportioned. The environment is elegant yet relaxed. The service was on the ball.
4,4,4,4,"Great menu, fabulous bread basket, knowledgable attentive service. Line cook loves to hit the salt hard, so if you are sensitive, tell them up front.Other than that, food hot, delicious and fresh."
5,5,5,5,"Carol and her team do an amazing job! Always great food and service. No request is too much trouble (even when the customers are causing trouble!). If you haven't had the warm shrimp salad or their chicken paillard, you are missing out!"
5,5,5,4,"Incredible food! From the bread and butter to the entree, everything was delicious. I had the smoked nova tartine and it surpassed all expectations. Only drawback was that the noise level was high which made lunchtime conversation difficult."
5,5,5,5,"As always, the food was phenomenal. We will be back again soon. Thanks!"
5,5,5,5,"Service was fantastic, the staff was on point. The food ... exquisite."
4,4,4,4,Always a great meal at ParcGood foodExcellent serviceNever had a bad experience
1,1,1,2,"The appetizer salad is very poor tasting and very expensive. It鈥檚 just several pieces of lettuce plus two or three pieces of potatoes and bacon, plus an egg which surprisingly has no taste in it! I could have made this ten times better by myself instead of wasting my money in your restaurant!"
5,5,4,5,"This has become my special happy place when I travel to Philly. I prefer breakfast to dinner, but that鈥檚 just me."
5,5,5,5,Visiting child at Penn
5,5,5,4,"Love this spot when in Philly. Great food, excellent service. This trip table location was in less than desirable location, they were unable to change our table , disappointing."
2,2,5,2,We were initially seated in a horrible spot despite speaking with them personally in advance about a nice table to celebrate our anniversary.  We were moved.  My Trout was salty and my husband's beef bourgogne had very little beef and the mashed potatoes were not hot.  We could not eat our dessert because it was so bad.  It was incredibly noisy.  We will not return despite hearing many positive things from other people.
5,5,5,5,Fun experience and delicious!
4,4,5,5,"As  always, a very good meal and great service. Starting with the bread basket right through the appetizers and the entrees the food does not disappoint. The staff is very attentive without overbearing and someone is always nearby to assist with whatever you need.  The desserts always look wonderful but a little short on depth of flavor. A definite recommend to anyone for any meal time."
4,5,3,4,"Parc continues to be reliable, delicious food.  That said, the noise level and crowded tables make it less enjoyable than in the past.  It is so loud, I was with one other person and we were seated so close to a large table that we had to scoot our table away and still had to yell at each other.  It was not relaxing.  We were there at 6:00 p.m.   Maybe we will try a later time period in the future."
2,5,5,4,Horrible table seating
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and service! Our server was very accommodating and helpful. The mushroom tart was one of the best things I have ever eaten.
5,5,5,5,"I love Parc. Consistently good food and service, and great ambience. It鈥檚 like a mini vacation every time I dine there."
4,3,4,3,"The food is good but I usually find it pretty salty across the board. Portion size is fine. The space is very live, especially when it starts to fill up -- hard to hold a conversation without shouting. Still, the location is convenient and the ambiance is fun."
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding food, service and value."
5,5,5,5,Love Parc!  Roast chicken always a winner. Lively atmosphere and friendly service too.
5,5,5,5,"Love Parc. Whether you go for a fun, romantic dinner or have dinner with a group of friends, Parc always delivers."
5,5,5,5,"Recommend? I go here for lunch with friends every month on my monthly visits? Why do I not go anywhere else? Why would I? The food is magnificent, the service is nearly always perfect (an excellent balance of professional and friendly), and the atmosphere is as if you walked into a Paris bistro. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. I recommend the steak frites, the moules frites, the quiche, the burger extraordinaire, and the trout almandine for lunch. For dinner, you are on your own and though I have been there for dinner, I can only recommend the entire menu. Oh! I forgot the mushroom tart as a starter to share for lunch--it is heavenly and just very homemade FRENCH! Okay, I think I am done."
3,4,4,3,It was VERY loud.  The food was good.  The service average.
5,5,5,5,Excellent food and service. We look forward to coming back soon!
5,5,5,5,Best dining experience I鈥檝e had. Excellent quality and very tasty. The service was attentive and personable. Just a perfect experience.
5,5,5,5,It was the best birthday ever! The staff was so enjoyable they definitely were apart of making my experience a pleasant one. The food was magnificent!!! Highly recommended. Per Se knows how to make a girl feel special 馃槏
5,5,5,5,"3 days later, and I am still thinking about the food. It was everything you would expect from a 3 Michelin star restaurant. We went for my birthday, and the menu had my name printed. I received a signed menu, along with special treats at the end of the dinner. I have been recommending Per Se to everyone!"
3,4,3,4,"The food was excellent, if not particularly creative. The Wagyu beef was out of this world. Service was seriously disappointing, ie: I had to request the same glass of wine twice, and when it finally arrived, food sitting on the table, it was the wrong one. No apology, but rather an excuse that the wine was 鈥減robably married with something else鈥(!) was given. Seriously. The waiter was a touch smug and casual bordering on unprofessional. A thousand dollar meal needs to be perfect. This was not. We have eaten at other 3 Michelin star restaurants and this one didn鈥檛 hold up."
5,5,5,5,Absolutely one of the best dining experiences. Everything was impeccable!
5,5,4,5,We were delighted to be able to get a reservation at Per Se for dining on our wedding anniversary.We arrived early with a view to having a pre-dinner celebratory drink but were told in an off hand manner that there was nowhere for us to sit and that there was another bar outside of the restaurant we could use so thought it could have been handled better. Since our last visit the bar area within Per Se has been turned into tables for dining so they have increased their covers.When we did get in we still had to wait for our table and so sat at a high bar area. The tasting menu was great with a lot of choice and standard of the food was excellent again so we weren't disappointed. The staff were very professional and happy to chat - getting the balance on this is quite difficult in my opinion and after a rocky start  they certainly succeeded.This is a very special restaurant and although expensive a place for celebrations.
5,5,5,5,It was excellent from start to finish.
5,5,5,5,Absolutely amazing! Best date ever!!!
5,5,5,5,It was my husband鈥檚 40rh birthday. They surprised us all the time. Amazing.
5,5,5,5,Per Se exceeded my expectations. The experience is worth the price. I hope to dine at Per Se again sometime.
5,5,5,5,Just 鈥楩abulous 鈥 in every way! A huge treat and well worth it!
3,5,5,5,"For me this is 鈥渄estination鈥 dinning. I go to NY  often and it鈥檚 nice to experience the top restaurants once in a while. This was semi short notice so the only time available was for Lunch on Saturday. Everything about the restaurant was super outstanding, especially the service, which is becoming rated these days. Unfortunately we were next to a table, they鈥檙e not that close, of four that included a 12-13 year old boy. It鈥檚 not that children are bad, it鈥檚 the failed parenting strategies that have forgotten about the seldom seen and never heard theories of children in upscale public places. I wish they would have a grown up only policy."
5,5,5,5,"This is a dining establishment beyond compare. Prepare to be pampered while you take in view of the NY skyline and relax in the glow of the fireplace. All waiters are graduates of a culinary school who will help you create the dining experience of a lifetime. 12 plates and an assortment of desserts are served to order at your leisure. The cuisine is original, and diverse with flavors that coax and tease the taste buds. The quality of ingredients is unrivaled; so much so that ""Bread and Butter"" is an entree - ""A smoked Paprika 'Parker House Roll' served with Diane St Clair's Animal Farm Butter."" Diane has 10 cows that she milks and hand churns the butter. No detail is left to chance. All chairs that are not required are removed from the table (before you arrive) so as not to disturb the intimacy. There are as many servers as there are guests who move stealthily to present your next palate-stimulating tasting.No matter your requirements (allergies, vegan, etc) Chef Keller and his staff will ensure that you literally have the meal of a lifetime."
5,5,5,5,"We had easily one of the best meals we have ever had at Per Se.  The tasting menu was incredibly well put together.  Each course seemed to improve upon the one before it.  The service was even better, with very attentive (but unintrusive) staff who took care to explain the dishes and get to know us throughout the dinner.  The pace was prompt, without being rushed and worked through the menu in just about two hours.  Capped off our experience with a kitchen tour and personal compliments to the chefs. Can鈥檛 recommend Per Se enough!"
5,5,5,5,Amazing! There are Michelin restaurants and then there is a Per Se.
5,5,5,5,"It is quite refreshing to enter a restaurant in NYC and have it meet your expectations. Per se did exactly that. The staff made us feel comfortable from the beginning, there was nothing rushed. The view of central park was simple and beautiful. Now the food, memorable, had a range of flavors in every dish, and also thankfully left us full and happy."
5,5,5,5,"Outstanding personalized service combined with incredible food. We were treated like royalty throughout the meal all capped off at the end with a tour of the kitchen escorted by the maitre d鈥, who couldn鈥檛 be more friendly. Not just a meal but a memorable experience!"
5,5,5,5,"I need to say Awesome service, every lovely server treat us like a friend!awesome food, both me n my husband love it, hope coming back again!"
5,5,5,5,One of the great experiences in my life that I will remember for evermore.It exceeded my expectations and I am so happy that I was able to get areservation.
5,5,5,5,"Lovely food, ambiance and service"
5,5,5,4,"Dining at Per Se is really beyond words.  It's an experience where 12 or 13 delicious, delicate and melt in your mouth courses are presented in a huge variety of plates, bowls and vessels of all kinds by young men and women who seem to appreciate being a part of the experience with you.  The fabulous three-hour treat was not stuffy but very fun.  Taking a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar afterwards was a double treat!"
5,5,5,5,"It was amazing. Food, service and ambiance were 5 Star."
5,5,5,5,"With 3 Michelin Stars and already haven visited French Laundry, another Thomas Keller restaurant, I had high expectations for Per Se.  And my expectations were met!  Stunning, dramatic, yet classy ambience, spotless professional service, creative and delicious cuisine.  Just a very special night and experience with friends."
5,5,5,5,This was my first experience at Per Se and I was so excited to go! My husband and I are junkies for Michelin Star restaurants and this was at the top of our list. Definitely met every expectation of a Michelin rated restaurant.
5,5,5,5,Holy guacamole! Chef Keller clearly pays attention to detail as every dish is specially curated. This ain鈥檛 yo鈥 mommas cookin鈥! Grab your napkin and hold on to your britches because there ain鈥檛 no stopping when you鈥檙e on this food train.
5,5,5,5,Fantastic for a special date or occasion
5,5,5,5,Besser gehts nicht ! Essen und Service einfach nur perfekt.
5,5,5,5,"Per Se was perfect. My wife, sister-in-law and I had dinner there at the end of a trip to NYC. It was a chilly evening and they put us next to the fireplace which was very cozy. The food was great. The service was impeccable. They were willing to accommodate changes to the menu if a particular item wasn't to our fancy. We were there for three and one half hours and it was among the most pleasurable dining experiences we have had. It is definitely a special occasion place. Go there when you aren't in a hurry and want to enjoy the best."
5,5,5,5,simply incredible!!!
5,5,5,5,Still one of the greatest spots in NYC. Bill maybe be a bit high but great memories are priceless! Every dish was a hit and the ambience was amazing. Very comfortable and enjoyable experience. Def get the supplements.
5,5,5,5,From start to finish our experience was flawless.
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and amazing service. Truly spot on. I do not think there could have been anything improved upon. Laurel provided a very memorable experience.
5,5,5,5,"Tyler the Maitre d' elevated our experience like no other restaurant we've ever been to. From helpful insider tips on other food NYC hangouts, to staying at the table for casual conversation, to a one-of-a-kind full tour of the kitchen, he was absolutely incredible. We loved every minute of our stay at Per Se and found it even better than its sister, French Laundry. All four of us would rate it as one of the best dining experiences we have ever had."
5,5,5,5,Celebrating my wife鈥檚 birthday. Fantastic food and everything along the way. They have everything thought out from drinks to food it was sublime
5,5,5,5,"Excellent food experience, courteous service, quiet and comfortable environment, food is missed. It is worth going to many times!"
5,5,5,5,Loved it.  Top 10 ever
5,5,5,5,"We celebrated our 10 year wedding anniversary with a trip to New York and a degustation dinner at Per Se. Our expectations for the dinner were high going in and Per Se exceeded them. The food was phenomenal, the service was attentive and the whole occasion just truly memorable."
5,5,5,5,"This was by far one of the most amazing dining experiences I have ever had.  The food was just incredible; but, the service and the experience were amazing as well.  Of particular note, was that we arrived with our 12 year old son and the restaurant staff from the front entrance and throughout the evening were so amazingly friendly and attentive to him as well as to us.  It made for a truly wonderful dining experience that we will never forget."
5,5,5,5,Amazing everything which is not surprising for a Michelin 3 star restaurant but in terms of value I think the vegetarian/pescetarian menus should be priced as high/represent the same value as the standard tasting menu. However overall one of best meals I鈥檝e ever had!
5,5,5,5,"Excellent attentive service from beginning to end. Complementary champagne to help us celebrate our special occasion to tour of the kitchen in the end, dining at Per Se is an experience, not just dining."
5,5,5,5,"We always save the Polo Bar for our last night in the City! It never disappoints. The wait staff is always so respectful and friendly. The food was divine. And, as always, it鈥檚 a great place to people watch. Can鈥檛 wait to return!"
5,4,5,5,"Very nice place, unique. Recommended to all people looking for something else ."
5,5,5,5,"I cannot recommend the Polo Bar enough. My boyfriend and I (not famous in any way) happened to dine at the Polo Bar the same night as a number of big name celebrities. There was absolutely no fuss and we felt equally as important and valued to our servers as anyone else in the restaurant. Food was also divine, I highly recommend the chocolate cake :) Thank you, Polo Bar, for a terrific experience."
5,5,5,5,"Very nice location, very good burger with lots of fries. The cheesecake tastes great and comes with fresh strawberries. Pricing is pretty reasonable. Service pays good attention and is very handsome. A nice place, especially for poloplayers."
3,3,2,3,Food wasn't that great but worth it to visit once I didn't really like the server who had kinda rude attitude (He was keep trying to make me order fancier meal options..)
4,5,5,5,"this place is a hoot! i have always wanted to go, but being there made me wish i was straight edge...can't believe that drinks can be over $30! however, the decor and the popovers help provide a bit more value to an otherwise fun and delicious, yet overpriced, whitebread new york experience."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful Birthday dinner for our son's 21st Birthday!!!
2,2,3,2,"I was very disappointed to say the least about my dinner here. The atmosphere was disappointing and I couldn't believe that the family sitting in front of me had their kid playing video game on his iPad at the dinner table. It was horrible and the couple sitting beside me was weird, anytime they coughed she kept apologizing that they didn't have any disease or nothing, it wasn't like I said anything to them.  The food wasn't great, only the cocktail was good. Overall, based that you had to have a reservation to get in here and then you see this, it's appalling. Places that don't require such a strict reservation policy have better class of people as patrons than this place. I wouldn't go back or recommend it."
5,5,5,5,The BEST! Love the Polo Bar!!
5,5,5,5,Just Great! We鈥檒l be back!
5,5,5,5,Always a must when I麓m in New York. I love the atmosphere and the food is good and not too pretentious.
1,1,1,1,"For such an 鈥渁ffluent鈥 Resturant, the guy who works at the reservation switchboard is of very low quality and standard and has no etiquette. Just his attitude and horrible telephone skills are enough to turn you off this place altogether. I would pass on this Resturant as there are far better quality places with amazing friendly staff who have people skills training. Def would not go back here!"
5,5,5,5,Amazing dinner. Waiter was one of best in City.
4,5,4,4,"The experience was great.The food was delicious, well served and the atmosphere excellent!"
4,4,5,5,"Great evening with friends. Service was perfect. Bar and wait staff were welcoming and  front of house was super accommodating when we were a tad late. Food quality is excellent. And those bar snacks, delicious."
5,4,5,5,Good food great atmosphere but very costly-55th and Fifth
5,4,5,5,"Service was excellent, Michael was the best waiter we鈥檝e had in the several times we鈥檝e visited here.  Food was really good and fairly good choices, they鈥檒l help if you need to tailor a menu item for specific reasons.  Nice cocktail options, and some varied gin selections."
5,5,5,5,Amazing service and totally delicious.
5,5,5,5,Cozy and chic Excellent service and reliably good food
5,5,5,5,"Start at the beautiful bar on the main floor.  Although expensive, the drink are creative and accompanied by a trio of delicious snacks. Arrive at least 30 minutes before your dinner reservation to relax and enjoy the experience. Move downstairs for an old school dinner.  The staff will be happy to split dishes in the kitchen.  The corned beef sandwich and burgers are exceptional.  It is a great place for a meal with friends and family."
5,5,5,5,Anniversary
5,5,5,5,I love The Polo Bar. Want to make plans for ny birthday next year!!! I love you Ralph Lauren!
5,5,5,5,"The food and the experience were both amazing, we couldn't have asked for a better night!"
5,5,5,5,"Excellent ambiance and service; we loved our dinner, especially the popovers! A wonderful place to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary!"
5,5,5,5,"Best restaurant, impeccable service, and delicious food. Special occasion, date night, or just for a good meal, it鈥檚 perfect. Excellent cocktails. My favorite is the Vesper Martini!"
2,1,3,4,"While the room is warm, decor nicely done,  & tables well-spaced, the food was very disappointing.  The popovers were delicious, but after one, we were not offered a 2nd, & without realizing it, our bread plates were removed.  We ordered what we were told were""must-haves"" --Shrimp Cocktail, Franks in Blankets, Corned Beef sandwich, Roasted Cauliflower, & none we agreed, had any distinctive flavor.  The experience for people around us, seemed to be focused on what celebrity might walk into the room."
5,5,5,5,"I have waited a year to get in this place. It was worth it! Great friendly, fashionable scene. Very attentive service. The food was very good.  Can鈥檛 wait to go back."
5,5,5,5,Stunning decor and atmosphere. Food and service were both excellent!
5,5,5,5,"Excellent, would highly recommend, best total experience over a week of tasting NYC !!"
4,4,5,5,It was my husbands birthday. He enjoyed every bit of his meal.
5,5,5,5,"A lovely Sunday evening dinner with friends. The space is beautiful, food excellent and service perfect!"
5,5,5,5,Outstanding service and food. Fantastic cocktails !!
5,5,5,5,"We love the Polo Bar. Great spot for a drink, and the food and service never disappoints."
5,5,5,5,Great food and ambience. A little noisy. Staff is very attentive and VERY professional I highly recommend.
5,5,5,5,A must go place in nyc!!!
5,5,5,5,One of the most exciting and exhilarating  One of the most exciting and exhilarating experiences I have ever had dining.
5,5,5,5,"Classy restaurant, excellent service."
5,5,5,5,Fantastic place. Get there early to enjoy a cocktail in the lounge. Great
5,4,4,5,Family dining early evening Very enjoyable very good service and excellent food . We had the New York strip and burgers All was well prepared and delicious
5,5,5,5,Everything about the Polo Bar was amazing! Looking forward to returning!
5,4,5,5,It was the perfect spot for a birthday celebration. Very memorable.
5,5,5,5,They were able to accommodate our group which had grown due to out of towners coming in. Everyone had a wonderful meal and a wonderful time! Our waiter and the hostess were phenomenal!
5,5,5,5,First-rate!
5,5,5,5,Beautiful!Food was fantastic!Waiter was impeccable!
4,4,5,5,A beautiful location and the service was perfect.  The menu could include a little more flavour but overall the food was good.
5,5,5,5,The Polo Lounge is unique and perfect. A McCarthy salad and a  chocolate souffl茅 under the trees  in the patio is a little touch of heaven.
3,2,5,5,"They took my favorite salad, the West Hollywood salad, off the menu, I was very disappointed."
2,2,3,3,"I鈥檝e been to this place twice before and enjoyed it.  The service, food and ambience left good memories. So, as a birthday gift for my daughter, I booked a table for brunch. We arrived and decided to sit in the garden of the Polo Lounge.  I want to say right away that I would have normally complained at the time, but I didn't as it would have spoilt the treat for my 16 year old daughter. I was very disappointed by a number of things, but I should say that my daughter ordered the French Toast which she told me was excellent. The coffee I had was very good. But, I also ordered the corned beef hash which was extremely poor. Much of the meat was tough and the onions were more or less raw.  I know this place is really expensive, but at $34 that just isn't good enough. I also ordered sourdough toast and what arrived was just one slice that measured about 6x4 inches of warmed bread that I would suggest was a long way from sourdough. I was charged $7 for this. And while we were having our meal, a number of waiters began moving furniture around right beside us. While doing this a glass fell from a table they were moving and smashed on the floor. They found this amusing. I didn't. We left having paid far too much for the wualiry of food served to us. I left feeling let down more than anything, and will not make a point of returning."
3,4,4,3,Overpriced! the valet parking should be free for costumers  in a 5 star hotel. Its good for people who like to showoff.
5,5,5,5,It was my son's 20th Birthday and we had the most marvelous time. Everything was perfect! thank you. Sherri Igo
5,5,5,5,Fabulous! Afternoon tea!
4,4,4,4,Way over priced!!
5,4,5,5,"Had A great time as usual! Little too pricey for their dinner entr茅es but I guess that goes with the territory. However, the quality of the food was very good."
5,3,5,4,The scenery is very relaxing. The staff is so welcoming!
2,2,1,4,"Took my Grandmother from out of town to The Polo Lounge as it is a staples of Los Angeles. We have never been so disappointed in a restaurant before. The overpriced menu, the mediocre food, and the absolute horrible service destroyed our experience at this beautiful space. We were let down in every single way and will sadly not be returning ever again. The Polo Lounge is nothing but a tourist trap, a place to be seen. It is for the wannabes and the restaurant takes advantage of that by up-charging their bland food to astronomical prices. A Caesar Salad drenched in dressing with soggy croutons for $34. What a waste. The service was atrocious. My grandma, who is 92 years old, almost fell because the waiter wouldn鈥檛 help her and rushed her to her seat. He then did not offer us water during our dine and took over 30 minutes just to get olive oil after we asked 3 different waiters. He did not smile, did not check on us once, and didn鈥檛 even ask us if we wanted dessert or a coffee. Just an overall disappointment, which is a shame because the space is pretty. The Polo Lounge is nothing but a tourist trap and if you expect to have a pleasant dining experience, look somewhere else. However, if you would like to be ignored, treated like a minority, and waste your money of soggy, tasteless, mediocre food, The Polo Lounge is the place for you!"
5,5,5,5,Birthday for wife.
5,5,5,5,"We went to celebrate our 25th anniversary and everything was beautiful! The service, the food,"
1,5,5,1,"i had a bad interaction with Eric the food and beverage manager , he charged me for a drink that a waiter accidentally spilled on me. In addition to that , a celebrity was willing to take a picture with me, but Eric told him no pictures were allowed inside the restaurant. It鈥檚 safe to say that I will never come back here again."
5,5,5,5,Amazing experience
4,4,4,5,Loved the atmosphere of the Polo Lounge especially the garden area where we were seated. The food was good as was the ambience. We loved the exclusivity of it all. A great one-off experience when in LA!
5,5,5,5,"Wonderful place to find in the heart of Beverly hills. One of my favorite restaurants in Beverly Hills and in all of His Angeles area. Excellent service and food, near perfect setting for a dinner date, highly recommend."
4,3,4,4,"Beautiful restaurant and hotel, been going there for many years. Great ambiance mediocre food."
4,4,4,4,"I would say not worth the price.  We were staying at the hotel, so it was convenient, but otherwise nothing special."
5,4,5,4,Always enjoy the quiet serenity of this restaurant. The old fashioned is excellent.
5,5,5,5,"Always a pleasure to dine at the Polo Lounge! Staff, ambiance, and food are top notch."
2,3,3,1,Beautiful restaurant with old world charm but food is a hard pass for its prices. Staff are dressed in formal white suits but serving people wearing flip flops and jeans. Loud uncouth characters bounce from table to table disturbing others trying to enjoy a romantic setting- assumed regulars as sadly staff do nothing but greet them by their first names. Plenty of reality tv personalities- but I guess that says it all.
5,5,5,5,Always a pleasure to dine here. Pepe is great and always takes great care of us.
5,5,5,5,"Sit inside if you want classy, have been coming here for years, outside has become loud and casual, choose inside our outside dining accordingly."
5,5,5,5,Perfect evening the staff made our dining perfect.
5,4,5,5,"An iconic and legendary spot. Granted, I was married there so I might be partial.  Nevertheless, it is a stylish and impeccably kept hotel. The polo lounge carries the mystique of generations gone by. It鈥檚 nostalgic; yet, simultaneously intimate and seminal. One strike is the price. It is particularly expensive. Obvious but still, be careful. You do get a tremendous value for the locale and especially the service. Not an everyday spot. A memorable visit among every type of person from all over the world."
5,5,5,5,Outstanding dining experience
5,5,5,5,I love going to the Polo Lounge as it is the quintessential lunch spot. The ambiance is beautiful  the service was impeccable!
5,5,5,5,Great food and outstanding service. It鈥檚 a must every time we are in Beverly Hills.
5,5,5,5,"I really loved how the patio seating and the indoor seating were all part of the same room. It was very cool on the patio even though the day was hot. We did sit in the patio area but even the interior part of the restaurant was open to the air. I ordered steak tartare and a small cheesecake, which was the perfect size at roughly 3"" diameter. My husband ordered a slice of cake which was enormous. The proportions of each fit the dish though. I loved the steak tartare, which was prepared tableside by the waiter to taste. We dont drink so I dont know about the wine selection or whatever. It was a mid afternoon dinner because that's when I get hungry so not many other people were there which was nice."
5,5,5,5,Excellent food and ambience for the most perfect date! Thank you!
5,5,5,5,"Simply the best!  Outstanding service, delicious food, perfect ambience.  This is the go-to place in Beverly Hills.  We were staying at the hotel, so it was an easy decision to make. Like the rest of the hotel, the Polo Lounge is as near perfect as you can get.  Pricey, but worth it.  I can鈥檛 wait to come back."
5,5,5,5,Great food great ambiance and one of my favorite restaurants!
4,5,3,5,"Service was the only real complaint. Our waiter disappeared several times. Luckily the guy in the section next to us was on top of things.  Food was amazing. Had the oysters to start, a Caesar salad, and I had the burger. Was amazing. My wife had the steak frites and it was also excellent. Price is what it is for this experience."
5,5,5,5,"Tour of the West Coast of America. This was part of my 鈥淧retty Woman鈥 experience and included a shopping spree on Rodeo Drive; sadly Richard Gere wasn鈥檛 there to pick up the tab...Lovely restaurant; food was amazing, service excellent. Really outstanding. Absolutely divine experience.My only criticism; learn how to do espresso, and really a restaurant of your calibration should KNOW what ristretto is, and be able to serve one..."
3,4,3,3,"This hotel is definitely riding on its history. Inside the Polo Lounge is dark, outside is shabby and dated with bugs. Another gripe is that they would not accept a UK driving licence as proof of age. The food was good, but nothing exceptional and the portion size of the Bolognese was small. The woman at reception was rude, however the young chap who whistled us a taxi was a delight."
2,3,4,2,The food was good but did not justify its pricing
5,5,5,5,"Amazing Steaks, Great attentive staff. Enjoyed dinner very much and would defiantly be back"
5,5,5,5,Amazing food and attentive service. We will definitely be back.
5,5,3,5,"As always Press is one of the best spots in Napa!  Great food, wine list & ambiance!  This time unfortunately, we didn鈥檛 get the best service. We ordered a very nice bottle of wine which was put into a carafe. Unfortunately, the carafe had a chip in it. We went to the manger and instead of apologizing she became very defensive. Actually said the crack has been there 鈥渁ll day鈥.  Very strange response. We were not looking for anything just letting her know.  The night got more interesting as there was a hair in our dessert. This time without requesting anything, the team stepped up delivered us a new dessert and a few treats. It鈥檚 amazing how a simple responses one way or the other can impact an experience. We love Press and wanted to share two completely different customer experiences. We鈥檒l be back!"
5,5,5,5,"From the moment we stepped into the building to the moment we left, we were treated like we were part of the family. From our server Kelsey to our Sommelier Taylor, we felt like we were the only people in the house. The wine recommendations were spot-on and the food was outstanding. It was our first visit to Press and it definitely won鈥檛 be the last."
5,5,5,5,"Second time at Press, even better than before. Service and seating was top notch. Wine selection excellent. Food and presentation were wonderful. Press is a top notch St. Helena eatery."
5,5,5,4,"After a weekend of nice meals, Press beats Auberge du Soleil hands down except for the view.  It is a little loud, but it has good energy.    The service was as expected. The Wine list is impressive but a little too much.   Sommelier earns his keep by up-selling."
2,2,3,4,Given the cost-- not worth it. Not bad but poor value. So-So salad.Steak was OK. Charging $6 for bearnaise sauce and $6 for pepper sauce  isridiculous given the cost of the steak. Loaded baked potato and dessertwas pretty average. I'd go back-- but probably take advantage of theirbar menu
5,5,5,5,"Everyone was outstanding. From the floor manager that took us to our table to the kid that cleaned our table. Everyone very professional yet friendly and with a radiant and contagious smile in the faces. Congratulations to the chef and his/ her team, our food was beyond outstanding. The sommelier was great with her wine suggestions. Several of our choices were not available in the list but we finally got a great selection. Definitely we are coming back soon."
5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, ambience. Nothing bad"
5,5,5,4,Fantastic service. Very upbeat ambiance although on the loud side. Menu had something for everyone along with some unique tasting experiences.  Steaks were great. Petroleum sole fish a bit underwhelming.  Wine selections were all Napa and had good value for both glass and bottle pricing. Worth a return visit.
2,2,3,5,Very average for the money
4,4,5,3,This was our first visit at Press. Overall it was a good experience. The food was really good but the price was to expense considering the way the plates were presented. I expect more from the chief in regards to plating. But we very much enjoyed the Cocktails and desert!We will be back but it may be a year or so.
5,5,5,5,Both the service and food were fantastic. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Napa
2,2,5,5,"Very disappointed in the quality of New York, very chewy for expressing the quality of beef that particular piece was not good. The beef fat truffle hash brown was $40 and only enough for 1 person. I realize truffle is expensive but come on potatoes aren鈥檛 portion needed to be larger on the potato part, or the wait staff should had expressed its small size when ordering. Wine, dessert and wait staff were great! Mixed emotions of returning"
5,4,5,5,"Service was top notch, the wine selection is amazing and the setting is gorgeous. If you are celebrating something special or just want to treat yourself, visit Press."
5,5,5,5,"Anniversary dinner was exceptional. Top notch wine recommended was very good and fine dining service was great. Highly recommend.  We had a NY strip and a bone in rib eye steak. Truffle hash browns, chilled prawn cocktail and iceberg wedge with blue cheese."
5,5,5,5,"The filet mignon, side dishes and drinks were delicious.  The service was superb.  Will definitely have dinner at PRESS the next time I am in Napa."
1,1,1,1,Terrible place.  Subpar food and not accommodating if you have special needs.  I would save your hard earned money and eat elsewhere.  Ruined one day of our vacation due to rigidity and insolence from upper management.
5,5,5,5,All around incredible experience.
3,3,5,4,"Very pricey for just decent food.  Screwed up a NY strip...can鈥檛 do that if you鈥檙e an upscale steakhouse.  Lobster Mac and bacon sampler were nice, but neither is worth the $40 charge."
5,5,5,5,We felt welcome from the first moment we entered the restaurant!  Our waitress Loretta was outstanding!  The food was superb!!
1,1,2,2,We will not be returning to Press. The food was the worst we鈥檝e ever had.
5,5,3,5,The bacon flight was great!
5,5,5,5,Exceptional service and food!  Everything was very well prepared.  One in the best restaurants to dine at in Napa.
5,5,5,5,"Surpassed all expectations!  Wonderful wine, food and service.  Call early for reservations."
5,5,4,5,Absolutely great dinner. Bacon tasting was great. Produce was so fresh and flavorful. Steaks were prepared perfectly.
3,3,4,4,"We鈥檝e heard good things about Press and wanted to try it.  Everything is insanely over priced. In the crazy category. The food was fine but not worth the price in our opinion. Tip, bring your own wine. They have an extensive cellar but the bottles are overpriced."
5,5,5,5,If you are in Napa Valley this is a must visit. One of the best places for dinner.
5,5,5,5,This was one of the best dinners we鈥檝e had in a long time! And it certainly was the best dinner we had in Napa Valley. Can鈥檛 wait till we can come back to press again.
3,3,3,4,"Being from Texas I understand we have a high standard for steak, and my filet was excellent. However my husband's ribeye was just meh. The cut was too thin and the meat fairly tough. Our salad and truffle fries were excellent. Service was professional and spot on, but not necessarily friendly, with the exception of the sommelier. She was delightful and helpful."
3,3,4,3,"Had to wait a long time for a table, although we had reservations. Steaks were not as high quality as the prices commanded. Sides were excellent."
3,3,5,5,"Great place, wine awesome, sommelier was so easy to talk to.  Apps were good, our steak was served warm at best.  Dessert were good.  Will give another chance, those steaks should come out sizzling"
5,5,5,5,"This experience could not have been better!! From the moment we walked into the restaurant until the moment we left we felt welcome. We have been in the wine country for a week and this was far and away the best meal we have had and I can鈥檛 imagine anything topping it. The steaks were spectacular and the service was beyond compare. Eric was our server and he was the right mix of friendly, professional and attentive. I highly recommend...this is a must do when you visit the Napa Valley!!(I feel like I must say that I am from the NY City area where there are many spectacular dining options so we are discriminating diners)."
5,5,5,5,"Excellent menu, food, staff and ambience. Sat outside and it was perfect!!"
5,5,5,5,"Great experience. Atmosphere, service from all the staff, selection of food, and the quality of our food was phenomenal."
5,5,4,4,Fabulous filet mignon! Highly recommend with Bernaise sauce -- although I did half au poivre with it.
4,4,4,4,The meal was delicious. Steak and lasagna both delicious. Service was attentive and pleasant.  Outdoor dining was pleasant and casual.
5,5,5,5,Absolutely fantastic food and a world class wine list.Served by a professional guy called Eric.A great chap.
5,5,5,5,The new chef at Press has brought a wonderful life to the menu.  He has added dishes out side of just steak and every one of them is superb.  Waitstaff and bar staff are always super attentive.
5,5,5,5,"Everything was impeccably perfect... the service, environment, and the food. Can't wait to return"
5,5,5,5,"Quince was absolutely outstanding. The service team is impeccable, the food is amazing, and the ambiance was great. I have dined at 3 Michelin Star restaurants before so there were a few things I knew to expect, but Quince goes above and beyond. My boyfriend and I had a fantastic time celebrating his 31st birthday here and we were lucky enough to meet Mr. and Mrs. Tusk as well as a look into their wine and kitchen. We had such a great experience and will definitely plan a trip back to San Francisco to dine here again. We are so glad we were able to make it and receive such an amazing experience."
5,5,5,5,"Perfect. Wine pairings were flawless. Service was excellent. Food was amazing, but in particular, it's the combination of all things working seamlessly together that makes the experience something to fondly remember."
5,5,5,5,"We own three restaurants ourselves and have grown up in the business. We have dined at several Michelin starred restaurants and can emphatically say quince is the best dining experience we have ever had. Chef Tusk continues to be a inspiration, the restaurant is at the pinnacle of dining. Congratulations to the whole team you deserve it Quinn and Nicole"
5,4,5,4,"I have eaten many Michelin Star restaurants. The food was good here but not amazing, presentation, sure.Overall the wine was the highlight of the night."
5,5,5,5,"SUPREMO, ESPECTACULAR TODO EN ESPECIAL EL SERVICIO"
5,5,5,5,"Simply spectacular, in every respect!"
2,3,4,5,"When you are spending 6 times what other very good restaurants would cost, and more than a new refrigerator,  I think you ought to expect everything to be perfect.  So, when I told the waiter that my wagyu beef was too salty and it would have been preferable to apply very little salt and allow customers to adjust for their taste, his response that he would relay this comment to the chef was inadequate.  There have been a few other occasions where I have had this issue at other restaurants and it is fairly common practice to comp the customer, in this case it would have been for the supplement charge.  This did not happen.But, even before we came for my wife's birthday, there was another issue.  The restaurant demanded confirmation in an email of the afternoon prior to our reservation which I did not see until the following morning.  Other fine restaurants we have gone to would call us to confirm not placing the burden on the customer and at the last minute.Compounding the above, I sent an email to Quince 4 days before writing this review but received no reply whatsoever.   They can't care about me, as a customer, if they don't even respond to an email."
5,5,5,5,Amazing mushroom all over the dishes. Best pasta cooking point I鈥檝e ever tasted.
5,5,5,5,This three star restaurant is for very special occasions. If you can afford the extra truffle course (while in season) it was the highlight of the evening- especially the 1967 wine paring.
5,5,5,5,The best my husband and I have EVER had.
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I have been to a lot of great restaurants over the years but Quince is right at the top.  Just sensational.  First of all it is a very elegant and quiet atmosphere.  The fixed multi-course meal is wonderful.  We also enjoyed their wine pairing which was also exceptionally nice.  They also have special dishes to add to the fixed menu.  On our night we loved the home made pasta with truffles.  Chef Michael Tusk 's rare talent is on display.  It was my wife's birthday and their extra kindness to us will never be forgotten.  Quince is expensive so save up for an unforgettable experience.  With many of the great restaurants closing in San Francisco, I am pleased to see Quince alive and prospering."
3,2,5,3,"The staff was amazing and attention was taken on every detail. The food, however, was pretty disappointing. It was photograph worthy at least, but I鈥檝e tasted far better for far less money. When all was said and done and we turned down the $85 and $100 menu upgrades, we still spent $1k for two people with tax and tip. Seriously it was worth $400 maybe. Out of 10 courses, two were flat out not good. I think those were the dishes that cost more to upgrade. I鈥檓 guessing with the added truffle or caviar upgrades, they may have been good. Kind of insulting to have to spend more for a decent meal when the price is already $295 per person.  The main course was roasted duck that was just OK. Unfortunately we had duck the night before at Girl and the Fig the night prior in Sonoma and it was awesome."
5,5,5,5,"Unbelievable dinning experience. Yes very expensive but the food and service is impeccable. The food presentations absolutely beautiful. Our chief server Shelbe was so helpful, great job! What a nice touch serving one course in the kitchen. It was great watching them work. Overall wonderful experience. Just expect to spend at least $500.00 per person"
5,5,5,5,Perfect tasting menu and pairing! Excellent service! I wish I lived in SF and had the chance to try all the other seasons menu.
5,5,5,5,Food was amazing.  Service was amazing.  Truly exceptional experience overall
5,5,5,5,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary dinner here on a Thursday night. The food was amazing, the service was impeccable and the wines were delicious. Simply a perfect experience!"
5,5,5,5,"Food was just perfect, and the waiters so nice!! It was a beautiful experience!"
5,5,5,5,"I鈥檝e had a chance to visit all 鈥渢he best鈥 SF restaurants.  We haven鈥檛 been to Quince in a few years and had a great evening.  A little problem with wine - the Som and I had decided on a few older Italian wines, but unfortunately, a number were corked.  He was very gracious, had tasted and rejected them all before they came to the table.  Great way to handle a wonderful wine list with mature wines.  A short delay but no 鈥渄ifficult鈥 conversations were needed about the status of the wines.  Where we ultimately landed was very good. Food was wonderful.  Long dinner, but beautifully paced with just the right amount of food.  I simply can鈥檛 handle the 25+ course tasting menus.  Thanks.   We鈥檒l be back.  Jeff Johnson."
5,5,5,5,Love this place and food:)
5,5,5,5,"Not just a meal, a life changing experience."
5,5,5,5,The dinner was excellent and we had the truffle course. The chef shaved the truffles at our table himself. The osetra choice was special and the service and ambiance great. We get to eat here once a year when visiting relatives and a friend in the San Francisco area. It鈥檚 always the best choice of restaurants in the town with many options.
5,5,5,5,Thanks for a wonderful experience. Every detail was perfect.
5,5,5,5,"This was a phenomenal night from the start.  I was admiring the art and the team shared with me the gallery they get the art from.  That attention to detail set the tone for the night.The food was delicious, exquisite, and left us wanting more.  The peas in a pod dish was amazing and the flavors were so powerful.  Combining the food with the amazing wine and non-alcoholic pairings made the night even better.  As a non-drinker my brother told me that the 鈥済in and tonic鈥 was as close to a real gin and tonic as you could have.  It truly made the night better.However the service was what the night truly special.  The team was attentive, conversational, and helpful throughout.  Theresa was particularly amazing.  She provided my brother recommendations for restaurants in Minneapolis where he goes for business.  I recommend Quince to anyone who wants to enjoy man evening of fantastic food and spectacular service."
5,5,5,5,"Quince is a special place.  We have dined here several times and it always delivers.  The tasting menu was creative and varied.  The main entr茅e was the best lamb I have ever tasted (right up there with Guy Savoy).  Veggie dishes of potatoes (fresh dug as they say), peas in the pod and fresh tomatoes were also excellent.  Throw in some caviar on squid strips and it was a magical meal.  We celebrated our anniversary here and were presented with personalize menus to bring home.  Classy service, just the right amount of interaction and attentiveness. The dining room is gorgeous, with interesting colors and art on the walls.  We also went with the recommended wine pairing menu (with one beer in it) and that complimented the meal wonderfully.  Now, a slight disclaimer.  This place will definitely lighten your wallet so be prepared to spent ~$700 per person, all in.  But, chef Michael Tusk has put together a fabulous dining experience worthy of the three Michelin stars it has earned."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful service and delicious food!
5,5,5,5,"In spite of the my misspelled name on the menu, the food was to die for and the service was impeccable."
5,5,5,5,very good!!
5,5,5,5,Absolutely fantastic dining experience at every level. Amazing cuisine that was so thoughtful from the preparation to the complex flavors to the presentation; service was five star and should be the gold standard for other any restaurant! This is the restaurant I would not think twice about coming back to when returning to San Francisco.
5,5,5,5,"We had an amazing experience! We simply loved all of it! We will never forget! Such a friendly, cozy and lovely place! The food is amazing!"
5,5,5,5,"Always perfection from the excellent food, the staff, the hospitality and decor. Leila is superb and it is very apparent that she enjoys ensuring that you have an excellent 3 star dining experience."
4,5,5,4,"Food, service, tastes, hospitality, everything perfect, superb. The restaurant for being a 3 star Michelins is too noisy. Leaving aside this particular, I suggest you try it, you won't regret it.Speciale."
5,5,4,4,Absolutely the BEST !!!  Truly enjoyed the evening there
5,5,5,5,Best service ever
4,5,5,5,"We鈥檝e eaten in countless Michelin starred and fine dining establishments and this was up there with the best. Yes there were a few hiccups to start with for instance I was served cool pasta which should鈥檝e been warm and there was a lot of up selling for alternative more expensive dishes however... the food was beautifully presented and genuinely tasted phenomenal (the wagyu was melt in your mouth buttery and totally delicious), great professionalism from staff and wonderful surprise of dining with the chefs which made our evening that much more special. Would recommend in a heartbeat."
5,5,5,5,"Quite possibly, one of the best dining experiences we have ever had anywhere in the world. The attention to detail and level of service is beyond imagination, even for the most discerning diners. You never want for a thing. The service is exceptional, elegant and everything you expect from a course driven dining restaurant. They made wonderful  choices for our mostly Pescatarian diet. We asked for a table change to a corner booth and were accommodated immediately. The champagnes and wine accompanying the imaginative courses is thoughtful and perfectly matched. We had no less than 10 persons attending to our every need, discussing each course, each bite that was fresh and sourced from a local farm. The courses are generous, and more than the 鈥渂ite鈥 you often receive at other multiple course establishments. Worth flying from LA to SF just to dine here. An unforgettable experience in every sense of the word."
5,5,5,5,Superb and exquisite dining experience
2,4,5,4,"I searched for Michelin 3 stars restaurant in San Francisco, the only one available for this weekend was Quince. The restaurant is elegant, the service is attentive. However they try to charge you as much as they can. The price was $295 per person. But the waiter talked us into paying additional $75 per person for 鈥渦nbelievable鈥 pasta dish, which was simply average. Also additional $75 pp for pairing with non alcoholic drinks, also additional $85 to switch lamb to Wagyu beef. By the time we added tips we spent more than $1800 for 3 people (luckily we don鈥檛 drink alcohol)."
5,5,5,5,Great Seevice
5,5,5,5,"What an amazing experience, great ambience, excellent service and phenomenal food!  Every course was an explosion of flavor and taste! We were treated to dessert in the kitchen, what an orchestra created by Chef, absolutely amazing to watch!  I would recommend Quince for any event but most importantly, I would visit on my own for dinner!!"
3,4,4,2,"Very ""hip"" place - loud, crowded, bar packed.  Food and service were both good.  Couldn't hear across the table, so don't go to have a conversation with your dinner partner.  Started annoyed with 6 texts, 2 phone calls, and 1 e-mail asking me to confirm reservation.  Each one answered.  Over-hyped place - won't go back"
4,4,4,4,"Partner enjoyed the food, then the bar with quite great  characters and conversation which made the night complete."
5,5,5,5,Fantastic as usual!  Raouls consistently delivers an amazing food and ambiance experience.  I鈥檇 recommend it to anyone and everyone!
5,5,5,5,Ever mouthful was perfection!! Love this place it鈥檚 So consistent for great food quality and service!
5,5,5,4,"This cozy but very loud restaurant is home to perhaps the most outstanding Steak au Poivre I have ever had. The cut of meat was excellent, cooked to a perfect medium and crusted in just the right amount and consistency of pepper... served with a perfectly seasoned sauce of exactly the right consistency... and of course accompanied by a basket of crispy Frites! It doesn鈥檛 get much better than this! Exactly what I would expect from an Alsace heritage which, arguably produces the best chefs in all of Europe!"
5,5,5,5,"Food was delicious, overall great experience"
5,5,5,5,Food and cocktails were fantastic.  Steak au Poivre was amazing.
4,4,5,5,"This was an amazing find on this past trip. It had an old school feel given all its history in the city. My son LOVED the burger. This is a kid who doesn鈥檛 like sauce or much adornment on his burgers so the meat has to be spot on - this burger didn鈥檛 disappoint AND the pepper sauce was so good, he ATE ALL OF IT!!  All the food was divine and definitely a staple for our yearly visits toNYC from now on!!"
5,5,5,5,One of my NYC favorites!!!
5,5,5,5,Loved everything
4,5,4,4,The food and lively atmosphere is always fantastic!
5,4,5,5,Great evening to enjoy my nieces birthday!

5,5,5,5,Always a great time at this legendary place
5,5,5,5,My favorite place in the city!!
5,5,5,5,Fabulous burger -- worth the hype! The fries were also a pleasant surprise too.
3,3,2,4,Overpriced but not remarkable.  The waitstaff was curt. I would not go back.
5,5,5,5,Exceptional service and food at this well known restaurant. Really enjoyed our evening.
3,4,1,5,"Good food, Poor service; table not ready, then after being directed to the bar were told we couldn鈥檛 transfer the bar bill to our table. Waiter was slow and inattentive, didn鈥檛 provide plates for the bread, didn鈥檛 once check in on the food, had to be asked three times for a drinks refill and provided dessert menus but didn鈥檛 come to take an order for 15 minutes...."
5,5,5,5,Great service and food! If you note a birthday celebration in open table they remember and add a candle to your desert which is great.
5,5,5,5,Fantastic night at this iconic new york restaurant.  The steak au poivre was perfectly cooked and delicious.  The choice of sides was great and the grilled broccoli was really tasty.  A huge wine list was also good with a massive selection of french as well as us wines.  Would definitely go again next time in NYC.
5,5,5,5,Great service. Nice wine menu. Delicious food. A true neighborhood gem. Can鈥檛 wait to go back again.
4,5,4,5,YOU WILL BE CHARGED $100 to cancel reservations. Still a great place!!
5,5,5,4,"Wonderful old school French brassiere with classic French cuisine done extremely well.  From the steak au pouvrie to the pomme  frites to the profiteroles you can鈥檛 go wrong.  Excellent service, as well."
5,5,5,5,Sexy crowd and the best steak au poivre in town. My go-to spot for a fun night out.
5,5,5,5,80th Birthday
5,5,5,5,Beautiful space with interesting artwork. The food and wine were great and the ambiance was lovely. Service was the best.
5,5,5,5,Raoul's will always be our favorite place. The staff and food (especially the burger) are the absolute best.
5,5,5,5,Great burgers. My neighborhood favorite!
5,5,5,5,"I LOVE RAOUL'S!  My husband and I meet for late dinners here and always roll home full, tipsy and elated.  The service is really always outstanding.  Everything from the bar/ host staff's greeting to the experience at the table makes us feel so well cared for; I find the interpersonal style of the team to be very direct, professional, and effective, but also always warm.  This place is such a New York institution; it's an absolute privilege to enjoy it from time to time.  Thanks to the whole damn team!"
5,5,5,5,Wonderful meal from beginning to end
5,5,4,5,Never disappoints!
5,5,5,5,"Amazing classic French style restaurant.The food is exquisite and the atmosphere fantastic. It鈥檚 not for those looking for a quiet night out as noise levels are high but I wouldn鈥檛 have it any other way. Efficient staff, eclectic artwork and food so delicious that my mouth waters at the mere thought of it! Go!! It should be illegal not to!"
5,4,5,4,Raoul鈥檚 is the best. It鈥檚 our regular go-to because while the food is really great (get the frisbee salad no matter what else you do)- the people are incredible and make you feel so welcome and at home. Plenty of celebrities come to this old school restaurant that has stayed popular for over 40 years but they treat  everyone wonderfully and care more how you behave than who you are
5,4,4,5,"Best steak au poivre ever, great Cosmo, fab music, cool scene. I will definitely return. Sometimes I look so hard for something new.... so glad I chose a classic to celebrate my husband鈥檚 50th."
5,5,5,5,"Tremendous spot.  A+ food, service. Traditional and current. Love it. Rivals the best."
5,5,5,5,"Great food, ambiance, service.  Hands down our favorite restaurant in NYC."
4,5,5,5,One of the best burgers in town.

One of our long-time favorites."

5,4,5,5,Outstanding service and beautiful atmosphere
5,5,5,5,"I brought a business colleague from France and who now lives in New York with me and he was very impressed with the meal.  He said the quality, taste,  wine pairings,  etc were all comparable to the best French restaurants in Paris or NY but at substantially lower cost. JR visited our table and talked to my guest in French for 10 minutes.  It was a delightful evening."
4,4,3,5,We love L. It is fantastic and the gourmand tasting is incredible.  This one particular night there were some issues with timing and flow that made the evening feel a bit off.  It was a special occasion and they were fantastically accommodating of some special requests and we were appreciative.  Overall it's the best true fine-dining in Cincinnati by leaps and bounds.
5,5,5,5,Everything was absolutely wonderful!
3,4,3,4,"We went for a special occasion and, for the most part, it was very nice. However, we felt the service wasn't as good as it could be.  We expect high-end service when we're paying high-end prices. From that perspective, we don't think we would go back."
4,5,4,5,The whole team is very conscientious and clearly focused on delivering a great dining experience. This was my birthday so we splurged on three different courses and each was excellent.
5,5,5,5,Birthday and going to a concert afterwards.
5,5,5,5,"An unbelievable experience!   We chose the Menu Gourmand- 5 courses ( not including the amuse bouche, cheese and dessert courses).  Paired with wine selections (8!).  We were not in a rush and we felt so welcomed by the staff that we let the hours drift along.  Actually left 5 hrs later.  (Other diners were out in 1-2 - totally up to you).  The dishes were exquisite-indescribable.  We were taken aback by the graciousness of the maitre d鈥檋otel, Richard, and our waitstaff, Holly.  They are masters of their art.  We were humbled by world renowned Chef Jean-Robert鈥檚 visits to our table to check on how our experience was going, thanking us and wishing us a happy anniversary.  Do not miss this experience!!  Please take your time, enjoy the food, the staff, the surroundings and your company."
5,5,5,5,Incredible!
5,5,5,5,"Very nice! Portion sizes perfect, atmosphere warm and inviting, and service was excellent!"
5,5,5,5,"The service, food, was fantastic.  I would highly recommend Restaurant L to anyone looking to have great time."
5,5,5,5,"Cincinnati finally has a worthy successor to The Maisonette and Pigall's. If you don't look out of the windows, you could imagine you're in one of many cities in the US or Europe -- a destination restaurant, a destination experience. The fixed-price (2+ or 3+ courses) with ""perfect wine pairings"" makes for an expensive, but NOT too expensive evening. An exquisite evening can be  had for 2-people for under $250, perhaps about the same as dinner at Morton's. Intimate and romantic with service that makes you feel special round out the entire experience.  A great special occasion restaurant, but priced to make it a consideration more frequently. Highly recommended."
5,5,5,5,"Richard Brown, Chef and their staff are incredible. A real experience!"
5,5,5,5,Everything was lovely. I had wine pairings with all my plates. The dessert was fantastic. There were five mini desserts. All the food was incredible with flavors that kept me wanting more. Even though this restaurant is pricey I left feeling full and satisfied. Totally worth it! I will be going back.
5,5,5,5,"The food, atmosphere and service was amazing. My friends and I meet in Cincinnati every year for our annual girls weekend. This was our first visit to Restaurant L and it will not be our last. Richard was charming and completely engaged with the patrons. If you are ever in the Cincinnati area and looking for a special place to dine, this is the place to go."
4,4,5,5,Fine birthday dining experience.
5,5,5,5,"Service was amazing and the food was even better. Highlights were the Lobster Salad and the Halibut main. The halibut was cooked perfectly, flaky, but moist. Presentation of all the dishes was delightful. I definitely recommend Restaurant L for special occasions, business meals, or nights out with friends, as long as everyone is aware of the price point."
5,5,5,5,Amazing experience and one of the best restaurants in town
4,5,3,5,"I had made this reservation for my wife鈥檚 birthday. We arrived at 6:15. The waiter was very 鈥渄isconnected鈥 and this continued as we spent almost three hours there. The food was incredible as it was the last time we were there! Service was slower than we remembered. By the time my wife got her birthday plate we had been there two hours. The worst was the name in the plate wasn鈥檛 my wife鈥檚. I did not include it In The reservation not did the waiter ask me so I am not sure why this happened. The poor guy (not the waiter) that brought the plate was embarrassed and went to bring out one without a name in it. The waiter saw what happened and retrieved the plate with the name on it and didn鈥檛 return for almost 15 minutes. After dessert, my wife motioned for the waiter to bring us the check. Overall Richard Brown does a great job here, but he may want to rethink this waiter. As a matter of tact, the waiter never told us his name. Probably for the best."
5,5,5,5,"Had our 28th wedding anniversary dinner here, what a fantastic experience.Food and service were outstanding, thanks to everyone for the memorable night."
5,5,5,5,"We recently dined at Restaurant L with some friends visiting from out of town. It was our first visit, and will not be our last. The service was excellent- including the owner, chef, and waiter, with whom we interacted quite a bit throughout the evening. The food was amazing- highly recommend the lobster salad, ravioli, and filet mignon."
5,5,5,5,Pricey but worth the money for an extremely unique experience. Best restaurant in cincy! #1 and we have been everywhere.
5,5,5,5,"Due to the Oktoberfest gridlock we were quite late for our reservation. When I called to alert the restaurant of our delay, I was very kindly treated and assured that things would still work out. Our server Tim made sure that we had a beautiful dining experience and still made it to the theater on time. We had just had entered into contract on a home purchase and were happy to be able to celebrate the occasion. Thank you for a wonderful evening."
5,5,5,5,We ordered from the Menu Gourmand. Every course was fantastic. Service was spot on. And the intimacy of the dining room rounded out a top notch evening.
5,5,5,5,"Restaurant L is one of my favorite special occasion spots, where my and my guests are pampered by distinctive service and innovative cuisine. It鈥檚 a rare treat!"
5,5,5,5,Restaurant L never disappoints.  It's by far our best restaurant experience in Cincinnati and well beyond.
5,5,5,5,L is not a restaurant serving good food it is an experience in fine dining that is not found in many U S cities...We should be happy and proud that you can enjoy an evening like this in Cincinnati....There is no match to L unless you fly to New York for the evening....What a great treasure we have here.....
5,5,5,5,"This may be the best, least known restaurant in Cincinnati.  Superior food, outstanding presentation; manages to be amazing without being stuffy.  Great experience!"
4,4,4,3,"The menu at Restaurant L offers a great modern take on classic French culinary preparations.  The flavor profile combinations are surprising and work delightfully.The restuarant describes itself as a Parisian-style restaurant with a little New York attitude and an abundance of Cincinnati charm.  Menu, aside, the experience is closer to New York style restaurant with a nod to Paris.  There are elements that harken back to the days of the Maisonette but they kind of get awkwardly stuck in delivery and it all doesn't *quite* get there.  The dining captain and management did do a very good job of ensuring that the dining flow was pleasant.In food preparation, the menu could probably do with a bit more frequent rotation to ensure that seasonal ingredients are featured.  All items were as well prepared and flavorful as possible but some of the ingredients just weren't at their seasonal peak and probably don't belong on a dish being served at a restaurant of that calibur of menu and price point.The pastry chef, Tracy, is absolutely one to watch.  All of the desserts in the farindole were explosions of flavor, yet not overpowering.  Each item brought defintive mouthfuls of the principal ingredient and the accompanying notes without being cloyingly sweet or too forceful of a flavor profile.Restaurant L was an enjoyable experience and has a very pleasant menu and I look forward to seeing it be fine-tuned and developed."
4,4,4,5,"The ambiance and food were impressive. The service was excellent once it occurred but there was a solid 30 minute interval between being seated and someone returning to our table... Even for a drink other than water. It was unclear if that was a part of the ""Parisian/New York"" experience or just an oversight. It was a Tuesday night with 5 other tables seated total, so not seemingly overwhelming. Richard was gracious and it's always exciting to see Jean Robert. Certainly still a great evening. Two courses with wine was plenty to be very satisfied but not miserable. Definitely a special occasion kind of place."
5,5,5,5,Nothing compares.  The service is excellent and the food varied and wonderful.
5,5,5,5,"The ambiance, food and service was wonderful. We went for our anniversary and can't think of a better place to celebrate in Cincinnnati. We will be back!!"
5,5,5,5,"Always the best.  Wonderful food, great service and beautiful surroundings."
5,5,5,5,"Everything at Restaurant L was amazing! The food, environment, wine pairing! Just everything was perfect! I would highly recommend dining at this wonderful restaurant! Chef Jean-Robert and his team did an incredible job!"
5,5,5,5,Best dining experience in years!
5,5,5,5,"It was our anniversary, it was a totally pleasant experience. They care, they are focused on the details. Food was great!"
5,5,5,5,"Fantastic service, superb food. My palate was overwhelmed with all the different layers and flavor elements. The overall experience was not shy of any 3 Michlein star restaurant in NYC. Absolutely phenomenal."
5,5,5,5,"This place is exceptional and Cincinnati should understand what a true bargain they are getting from such an exceptional Chef and Menu! We did the Gourmand Menu with the wine pairing which was a steal at $190 per person... more than enough food to fill anyone up... the pours on the wine are perfect and match exceptionally well with the food... we had one wine, which was a white Vermouth from Spain (I believe) which was very odd tasting and for which they offered an alternative, which was very nice of them - otherwise do not miss out on the wine pairing unless you do not enjoy wine! One of the better fixed menu restaurants I have been to in some time... the cheese service and desserts are amazing which come after you have enjoyed so many good courses... well worth a visit if you are from out of town like us... Appreciate this place Cincinnati! Review from a Bomber now living in Texas..."
5,5,5,5,"Magical is the adjective that describes every aspect of our dining experience. The ambiance, with the tree sculpture and baskets of fresh flowers hanging from it; the food (鈥渇ood鈥 sounds banal鈥 better: des plats exquis) courses were fabulous, with a touch of whimsy; the wine pairings perfect and imaginative; the service professional and engaging at the same time. Unlike in many places, we were not rushed to make room for the next sitting, but we were allowed to eat mindfully and slowly and savor every morsel.  Thank you Jean Robert and Richard Brown and Alex and all the other gentle folks who enhanced our wellbeing for a memorable holistic experience."
5,5,5,5,We had dinner in the bar and it was a wonderful yet different experience from the dining room.
5,5,5,5,Cesar is a tremendous host.  Juan and his service colleagues work together like a fined tuned orchestra.  Always top notch.
5,5,5,5,Riccardo Enoteca is always wonderful - the food is delicious and everyone that works there is very nice!
5,5,5,5,Always a great dining experience
5,5,5,5,"I have eaten here twice and had a lovely experience both times.  The second occasion was to spend time with friends who were visiting from out of town.  They loved it as well.  On both occasions, the salad was fresh, and the food was hot and consistent in terms of flavor and portions.  They also provide great service.  Very attentive."
5,5,5,5,Small cute little restaurant with amazing food and service:-)
5,5,5,5,"Excellent experience, great food and attentive service!"
5,5,5,5,Great food and service. I recommend this place as one of the best in Lincoln Park.
5,5,5,5,"Absolutely incredible dinner, we will be back soon!"
5,5,5,5,"I love this place , service and food are outstanding."
5,5,5,5,Wonderful meal. Attentive service. Nice atmosphere.
5,5,4,5,High quality traditional Italian cuisine. Comfortable place. Some communication problems with friendly and generally competent server. Will go again. Personally value non-trendy quality.
5,5,5,5,Great food. Amazing selection. Good value. Neighborhood gem.
